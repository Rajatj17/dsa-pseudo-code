The given pseudo-code defines a binary search tree (BST) and a function to find the next inorder successor of a given node in the BST. The main function demonstrates the usage of the BST and the inorder successor function.

The key points are:
1. Definition of the Node class with key, left and right pointers.
2. Insertion of nodes into the BST using the `insert` function.
3. Printing the nodes of the BST in inorder traversal using the `printInOrder` function.
4. Finding the inorder successor of a given node using the `inorderSucc` function.
5. The main function demonstrates the usage of the BST and the `inorderSucc` function by finding the inorder successors of specific nodes.

To follow up on this pseudo-code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain how the `insert` function works and its time complexity?
2. How does the `inorderSucc` function find the inorder successor of a given node?
3. What is the time complexity of finding the inorder successor in this BST?
4. Can you explain the concept of inorder traversal and how it relates to finding the inorder successor in a BST?
5. How would you handle cases where the given node does not have an inorder successor in the BST?

Time complexity:
- Insert function: O(h), where h is the height of the BST.
- Inorder traversal: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST.
- Finding inorder successor: O(h), where h is the height of the BST.

Space complexity:
- Insert function: O(h), where h is the height of the BST (recursive stack space).
- Inorder traversal: O(h), where h is the height of the BST (recursive stack space).
- Finding inorder successor: O(1), as it only uses a few extra pointers.

Interviewer can also ask to implement the conversion of the given BST to a sorted doubly linked list.
