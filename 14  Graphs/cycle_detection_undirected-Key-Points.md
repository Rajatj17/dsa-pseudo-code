Key points in the given code:
1. A Graph class is implemented using an adjacency list representation with list of integers and a vector for storing the edges.
2. The class includes a method to add edges to the graph and a method to check for cycles using depth-first search (DFS).
3. The DFS method marks nodes as visited and explores adjacent nodes recursively to detect cycles in the graph.
4. The contains_cycle function initializes a Graph object and adds the given edges to it, then checks for cycles using the Graph's contains_cycle method.

To follow up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Explain the implementation of the Graph class and its methods.
2. How does the depth-first search algorithm help in detecting cycles in the graph?
3. What is the significance of the parent parameter in the DFS method?
4. Can you explain the flow of the contains_cycle function and how it utilizes the Graph class to check for cycles?
5. Are there any alternative approaches to detect cycles in a graph?

Time complexity:
- The time complexity of adding edges to the graph is O(1) per edge, therefore adding all the edges takes O(E) time.
- The time complexity of the DFS method is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- Thus, the overall time complexity of checking for cycles in the graph is O(V + E).

Space complexity:
- The space complexity of the Graph class is O(V + E) to store the adjacency list and the vector.
- The space complexity of the contains_cycle function is O(V) to store the visited nodes.
- Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(V + E).

Interviewer can ask about the optimization techniques to reduce the time complexity of the contains_cycle function and potential improvements in space complexity. They can also discuss real-world applications of detecting cycles in a graph and its significance in various domains such as network routing, social network analysis, and scheduling problems.
