The given code implements an undirected graph using an adjacency list representation. It consists of a `Node` class to represent each city and a `Graph` class to represent the graph and perform operations on it. The `Node` class contains the name of the city and a list of neighboring cities, while the `Graph` class uses an unordered map to store the mapping from city names to Node objects.

The `Graph` class has methods to initialize the graph with a list of cities, add edges between cities, and print the adjacency list representation of the graph.

Pseudocode for the graph representation is as follows:

```plaintext
Class Node:
    name
    nbrs

    Constructor(name):
        this.name = name

Class Graph:
    m

    Constructor(cities):
        for each city in cities:
            m[city] = new Node(city)

    addEdge(x, y, undir=false):
        m[x].nbrs.push_back(y)
        if undir is true:
            m[y].nbrs.push_back(x)

    printAdjList():
        for each cityPair in m:
            city = cityPair.first
            node = cityPair.second
            print city
            for each neighbor in node.nbrs:
                print neighbor
            print newline
```

To follow up on this pseudocode in an interview, you could ask the interviewee to implement additional methods for the `Graph` class, such as checking if there is an edge between two cities, performing a breadth-first search or depth-first search, or removing an edge from the graph.

**Time Complexity:**
- Creating the graph: O(V), where V is the number of vertices (cities).
- Adding an edge: O(1) for each edge.
- Printing the adjacency list: O(V + E), where E is the number of edges, as it involves iterating through all vertices and their neighbors.

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity of the graph is O(V + E), where V is the space required for storing the vertices and E is the space required for storing the edges in the adjacency list.
