The given code contains a Graph class and a main function that creates a graph and performs a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal.

To summarize the code:
1. The Graph class has a constructor that initializes the number of vertices and creates an array of lists to represent the adjacency list for each vertex.
2. The addEdge function adds an edge between two vertices, and it has an optional parameter to indicate if the graph is undirected.
3. The dfsHelper function is a recursive function to perform the DFS traversal starting from a given node, marking visited nodes and visiting unvisited neighbors.
4. The dfs function initializes a boolean array to keep track of visited nodes and then calls the dfsHelper function to start the DFS traversal from a given source node.
5. The main function creates a Graph object with 7 vertices, adds some edges, and performs a DFS traversal starting from vertex 1.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer might ask:
- How would you modify the code to perform other graph traversal algorithms like Breadth First Search (BFS)?
- Can you explain the time and space complexity of the DFS traversal in this code?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of DFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because in the worst case, we may have to visit all the vertices and edges of the graph.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the DFS traversal in this code is O(V), where V is the number of vertices. This is due to the boolean array used to keep track of visited nodes during the traversal. Additionally, the adjacency list representation of the graph also contributes to the space complexity.
