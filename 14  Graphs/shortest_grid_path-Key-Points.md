The provided code is a C++ implementation to find the shortest path in a 2D grid using Dijkstra's algorithm. 

Here are the key points to solve the problem:
1. Create a class Node to represent each cell with its coordinates and distance from the starting point.
2. Use a set and a custom comparator to maintain the set of nodes in non-decreasing order of distance.
3. Initialize a 2D vector to store the distances of each cell from the starting point with INT_MAX.
4. Add the starting node to the set and set its distance to 0.
5. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to explore the grid and update the distances of neighboring cells if a shorter path is found.
6. Update the set with the new distances and their corresponding cells.
7. The shortest path length will be the distance of the destination cell after the algorithm finishes.

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
- Explain Dijkstra's algorithm and its application in this code.
- Discuss the purpose of the comparator class and the set usage in the code.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution and identify potential optimizations.

Time Complexity: O((M*N)log(M*N)) where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid.
Space Complexity: O(M*N) for the 2D distance vector and the set to store nodes.
