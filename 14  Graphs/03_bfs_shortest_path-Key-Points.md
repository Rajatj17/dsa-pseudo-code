The given code is a C++ implementation to perform the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm on a graph.

1. It uses a queue to keep track of nodes to be visited in the BFS traversal.
2. It maintains the parent of each node and the distance of each node from the source node.
3. It also prints the shortest distance from the source node to every other node in the graph.
4. It can also print the path from a given source to a destination node if specified.

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. How would you modify the code to handle weighted edges in the graph?
2. Can you explain the time and space complexity of the BFS algorithm used in this code?
3. How would you handle disconnected components in the graph using this code?

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because each vertex and each edge is explored once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the BFS algorithm is O(V), where V is the number of vertices in the graph. This is due to the space used for the queue, visited array, parent array, and distance array, each of size V.
