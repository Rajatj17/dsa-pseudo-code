The given code is an implementation of a graph using an adjacency list representation in C++.

Here are the key points from the code:
1. The `Graph` class represents a graph using an adjacency list.
2. It has a constructor `Graph(int v)` to initialize the number of vertices and allocate memory for the adjacency list.
3. The `addEdge` method is used to add edges between vertices. It takes two parameters `i` and `j` representing the vertices. The third parameter `undir` is a boolean flag to indicate whether the graph is undirected (default is true).
4. The `printAdjList` method is used to print the adjacency list of the graph.

The `main` function creates a graph with 6 vertices and adds some edges between them. Finally, it prints the adjacency list of the graph.

To follow-up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. How would you modify the code to support weighted edges in the graph?
2. Can you implement a method to perform depth-first search (DFS) on the graph?
3. How can you implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm using this graph representation?
4. Discuss the time and space complexity of the given code.

Time complexity:
- Adding an edge between vertices: O(1)
- Printing the adjacency list: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges

Space complexity:
- The space complexity of the adjacency list representation is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
