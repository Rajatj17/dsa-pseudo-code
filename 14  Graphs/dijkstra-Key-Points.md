Key Points:
1. The given code implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
2. The Graph class has functions to add edges and find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
3. Dijkstra's algorithm uses a set to keep track of the minimum distance to each node from the source node.
4. The algorithm iterates through the neighbors of each node and updates the minimum distance if a shorter path is found.

Follow-up for the interviewer:
The interviewer can discuss the details of Dijkstra's algorithm, how the set container is being used to maintain the minimum distance, and the process of updating the distances. Additionally, they can discuss how the Graph class can be modified to support different types of graphs or to handle edge cases.

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(V) for the distance vector and O(V) for the set, where V is the number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(V).
