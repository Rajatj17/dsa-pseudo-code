The given code contains a class `Graph` with methods to check for cycles in a directed graph using depth-first search (DFS).

Here is the pseudocode for the `contains_cycle` method in the `Graph` class:

1. Create a `Graph` class with a list of adjacency lists and total number of vertices.
2. Add an edge between two vertices using the `addEdge` method.
3. Implement a DFS-based `dfs` method to check for cycles, which takes the current node, a vector of visited nodes, and a vector of nodes in the current stack as input.
4. In the `dfs` method, mark the current node as visited and in the stack, perform DFS traversal for each neighbor of the current node.
5. If a neighbor is already in the current stack, return `true` indicating a cycle is found.
6. If a neighbor is not visited, call the `dfs` method for that neighbor.
7. Return `false` if no cycle is found within the DFS traversal.
8. Finally, in the `contains_cycle` method, iterate through all nodes and call the `dfs` method for each unvisited node to determine if any cycle exists in the graph.

The interviewer can follow-up on this pseudocode by asking about the implementation details of the methods, such as adding error handling, implementing a different algorithm for cycle detection, or discussing potential optimizations.

Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because we perform DFS on all the vertices and iterate through all the edges in the worst case.

Space Complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices. This is because we use additional space for the visited and stack vectors, each of size V, to keep track of visited nodes and nodes in the current stack during the DFS traversal.
