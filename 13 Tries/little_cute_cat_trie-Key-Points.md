The given psuedo code is building a prefix tree (Trie) and using it to search for specific words in a given document. Here are the key points:

1. Trie class is used to build a prefix tree of the words provided.
2. The insert method is used to insert words into the Trie.
3. The searchHelper function is used to search for words in the document using the Trie.
4. The documentSearch function iterates through the document and checks for the presence of each word in the Trie, then prints whether each word is present or not.

To follow up on this pseudocode, the interviewer could ask the following questions:
- Explain the usage of each function in the Trie class.
- How does the searchHelper function find words in the document using the Trie?
- Can you explain the logic behind the documentSearch function and how it uses the searchHelper to find words in the document?

Time Complexity: 
- The time complexity for building the Trie is O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words.
- The time complexity for searching in the document using Trie is O(m * k), where k is the length of the document.

Space Complexity: 
- The space complexity for the Trie is O(n * m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of unique characters in the words.

Overall, this pseudocode efficiently utilizes a Trie data structure to search for words in a given document, with a time complexity of O(n * m) and space complexity of O(n * m).
