The given code is to check whether the given input string contains balanced parentheses or not. It uses a stack to keep track of opening parentheses and then checks if the corresponding closing parentheses are found or not.

Pseudo Code:
1. Create a stack to store opening parentheses.
2. Iterate through the input string.
3. If the current character is an opening parentheses, push it onto the stack.
4. If the current character is a closing parentheses, check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, pop from the stack, else return false.
5. After iterating through the string, if the stack is empty return true, else return false.

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. How does the stack help in checking for balanced parentheses?
2. What is the purpose of the switch case statement in the code?
3. Can you explain the time and space complexity of this algorithm?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through the string once and each operation inside the loop (push, pop, top) takes O(1) time.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the input string. This is because in the worst case scenario, the stack could contain all the opening parentheses in the string.
