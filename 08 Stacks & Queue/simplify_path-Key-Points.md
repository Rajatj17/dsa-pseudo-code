The code is a C++ implementation of simplifying a given absolute path of a file system. The main steps involved in the code are as follows:

1. Tokenisation & Filtering:
   - Split the input path using the '/' delimiter and filter out "." or empty tokens.

2. Handling '..' (parent directory):
   - Create a stack to keep track of the directories.
   - If the token is "..", handle absolute and relative paths accordingly. If not, push the token into the stack.

3. Combining elements in the stack to form the simplified path.

The pseudo code outlines the implementation of simplifying a given absolute path by handling "." and ".." effectively.

Interviewer follow-up:
To further discuss the pseudo code, the interviewer can inquire about the input constraints for the path and potential edge cases that need to be handled. Additionally, discussing the efficiency of the code, potential optimizations, and alternative approaches for simplifying the path would be beneficial.

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the input path. This is because we iterate through each character of the path once and perform constant time operations (pushing, popping, concatenating strings).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the input path. This is due to the space used by the tokens vector, stack, and the output string.

Overall, the code provides an efficient solution for simplifying absolute paths in a file system.
