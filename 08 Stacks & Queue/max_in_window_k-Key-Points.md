The given pseudocode is an implementation of the sliding window maximum problem using a deque data structure. Here are the key points:

1. We are given an array of integers `a` and a window size `k`.
2. We need to find the maximum element in every subarray of size `k`.

Here's a brief explanation of the algorithm using a deque:
- We use a deque `Q` to store the indices of elements in the current window of size `k`.
- We process the first `k` elements to initialize the deque.
- Then, we iterate through the remaining elements of the array and apply the following logic for each element:
  - Remove elements from the left of the deque that lie outside the current window.
  - Remove smaller elements from the back of the deque as they cannot be the maximum in the current or any future window.
  - Push the current index into the deque.
  - Output the maximum element in each window.

To follow up on this pseudocode in an interview, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the purpose of using a deque in this algorithm?
2. Why do we need to process the first `k` elements separately?
3. How would you modify this algorithm to find the minimum element in every subarray of size `k`?
4. What are the time and space complexities of this algorithm?
  
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(k)

Interviewer can also ask to dry run of the given algorithm with a sample input.
