The given code is an implementation of finding the first non-repeating character in a running stream of characters. 

1. It uses a queue to store the characters in the running stream and an array to store the frequency of each character.
2. For each character in the input stream, it updates the frequency array and checks the queue to find the first non-repeating character.
3. If the queue becomes empty, it means there is no non-repeating character in the stream.

To follow-up on this pseudocode, the interviewer can ask for the following:
- How to handle uppercase letters and non-alphabetic characters in the input stream?
- How to optimize the code for large input streams?
- Can you implement the solution using a different data structure instead of a queue?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the given code is O(n) where n is the number of characters in the running stream.

Space Complexity: 
The space complexity of the given code is O(1) for the frequency array and O(n) for the queue, where n is the number of characters in the running stream.
