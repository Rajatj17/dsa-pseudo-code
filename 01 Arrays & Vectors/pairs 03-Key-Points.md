The given problem is to find a pair of elements in the given array whose sum is equal to the given target sum. If such a pair exists, the program should return the pair of elements; otherwise, it should return an empty vector.

Pseudo code:
```plaintext
pairSum(arr, Sum):
    Create an empty unordered set s
    Create an empty vector result
    for i = 0 to arr.size() - 1:
        Calculate x = Sum - arr[i]
        if (x is found in set s):
            Append x and arr[i] to the result vector
            Return result
        Insert arr[i] into set s
    Return an empty vector

Main():
    Initialize arr and S
    Call pairSum(arr, S) and store the result in p
    If p is empty:
        Output "No such pair"
    Else:
        Output the elements in p
```

Follow-up questions for the interviewer:
1. Can you explain the time complexity and space complexity of your solution?
2. Can you suggest any optimizations or alternative approaches to solve this problem?
3. What would be the impact of using a different data structure, such as a map, instead of an unordered set?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `pairSum` function is O(n) because it iterates through the input array once.
- The time complexity of the main function is also O(n) because it calls the `pairSum` function, which has O(n) time complexity.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the `pairSum` function is O(n) because it uses an unordered set to store elements from the input array.
- The space complexity of the main function is O(n) because it creates a vector to store the input array.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n).
