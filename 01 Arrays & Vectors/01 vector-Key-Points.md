To summarize the given C++ code:
1. It includes the necessary libraries for input/output and vector manipulation.
2. It creates a vector `arr` with 10 elements, each initialized to 7, using the fill constructor.
3. It creates another vector `visited` with 100 elements, each initialized to 0, using the fill constructor.
4. It removes the last element from the `arr` vector using the `pop_back()` function.
5. It adds a new element with the value 16 to the end of the `arr` vector using the `push_back()` function.
6. It then prints all the elements in the `arr` vector.

The interviewer can follow up on this by asking about:
1. The benefits of using vectors in C++ over arrays.
2. Different ways to initialize vectors in C++.
3. The time complexity of various vector operations.
4. Advantages and disadvantages of using vectors in C++.

Time Complexity:
- Constructor: The time complexity for the constructor is O(n), where n is the number of elements being initialized.
- pop_back: The time complexity for removing the last element from the vector is O(1).
- push_back: The time complexity for adding an element to the end of the vector is O(1).
- Printing elements: The time complexity for printing all the elements in the vector is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity for creating vectors with n elements is O(n) as it requires memory proportional to the number of elements.

By discussing the above complexities, the interviewer can assess the candidate's understanding of vector operations and memory usage in C++.
