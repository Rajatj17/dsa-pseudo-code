The given code is a C++ implementation to find the length of the largest contiguous band in an input array. A band is defined as a subsequence of numbers with consecutive integers, and the task is to find the length of the largest band.

The main steps in the code are as follows:
1. Use an unordered set to store unique elements of the input array.
2. Iterate over the set elements and for each unique element, check if its predecessor is not present in the set.
3. If the predecessor is not present, then find the entire band by checking the consecutive integers in the set and update the largest length if a larger band is found.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can consider the following:
- Ask the interviewee to explain the logic behind using an unordered set and the approach used to find the largest band.
- Discuss potential optimizations or alternative approaches to solve the problem.
- Test the code with different input arrays to ensure its correctness and efficiency.

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the given implementation is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the code iterates over the array and performs set operations, both of which have a linear time complexity.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) as it uses an unordered set to store the unique elements from the input array.

By asking these follow-up questions, an interviewer can assess the candidate's understanding of set operations, data structures, and the ability to optimize the solution.
