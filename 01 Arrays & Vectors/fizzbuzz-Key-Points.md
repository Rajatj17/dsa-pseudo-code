The given code defines a function `fizzbuzz` that takes an integer `n` and returns a vector of strings containing the FizzBuzz sequence up to `n`. The FizzBuzz sequence is a sequence of numbers where multiples of 3 are replaced with "Fizz", multiples of 5 are replaced with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz".

Here's a breakdown of the pseudo code:

1. Define a function `fizzbuzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a vector of strings.
2. Initialize an empty vector of strings called `result`.
3. Iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n`.
4. For each number, check if it's a multiple of 15, 5, 3, or none of them and add the corresponding string to the `result` vector.
5. Return the `result` vector.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain how the FizzBuzz sequence is generated in this function?
2. How would you modify this function to handle a different set of replacement words for different multiples?
3. Can you optimize this function to reduce memory usage?

Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the input integer. The function iterates over each number from 1 to n once, so the time complexity is linear.

Space Complexity: O(n) - where n is the input integer. The space complexity is linear as the vector `result` can potentially store n strings in the worst case.
