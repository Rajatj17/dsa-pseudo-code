## Problem Statement

You are given a C++ code that demonstrates the usage of vectors. Vectors are dynamic arrays in C++ and the code performs various operations such as initialization, insertion, and traversal of vectors. 

Your task is to write the pseudo code explaining the given C++ code.

## Example Input

### Input
```
N/A
```

### Output
```
N/A
```

## Pseudo code

```
1. Create a vector arr and initialize it using the fill constructor with a size of 10 and the value 7.

2. Create a vector named visited and initialize it using the fill constructor with a size of 100 and all elements as 0.

3. Remove the last element from the vector arr using the pop_back method.

4. Add a new element with the value 16 to the end of the vector arr using the push_back method.

5. Iterate through the elements of the vector arr using a for-each loop and print each element followed by a comma.

6. Return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program.
