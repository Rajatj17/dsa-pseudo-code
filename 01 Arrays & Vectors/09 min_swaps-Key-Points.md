The given code is for finding the minimum number of swaps required to sort an array.

1. First, the code creates a pair of elements and their indices and then sorts this pair based on the element value.
  
2. Next, a vector of bools is created to track visited elements. 

3. The main logic of the algorithm is then implemented using the concept of cycles. It finds the cycles in the array and calculates the number of swaps required to bring those cycles to their correct position.

4. Finally, the total number of swaps needed is returned.

To further improve the code, you can:
- Add comments to explain the logic and improve readability.
- Encapsulate the logic in a separate function for better code organization.

Follow-Up: To make the code more efficient, you can possibly use a different approach to solve the given problem. The interviewer can ask you to optimize the current solution's time or space complexity, or they may want you to consider different edge cases.

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the given code is O(nlogn) because of the sorting step, where n is the size of the input array.

Space Complexity: 
The space complexity of the given code is O(n) because of the space used by the vector of bool and the pair of elements and their indices.
