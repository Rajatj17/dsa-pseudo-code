The given code is a C++ program to find all triplets in an array that sum up to a given target sum using the two-pointer approach.

Pseudocode:
1. Sort the input array.
2. Initialize an empty vector to store the result triplets.
3. Iterate through the array with a loop variable i from 0 to n-3.
4. Inside the loop, initialize two pointers j = i + 1 and k = n - 1.
5. Use a while loop with the condition j < k to find triplet combinations.
6. For each iteration, calculate the current sum using elements at indices i, j, and k.
7. Check the current sum against the target sum and adjust pointers j and k accordingly.
8. If the current sum equals the target sum, add the triplet to the result vector and increment j and decrement k.
9. Return the result vector containing sum-equal triplets.

To follow-up on this pseudocode during an interview, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the two-pointer approach and its benefits in this problem?
2. Can you analyze the time complexity and space complexity of the provided solution?
3. How would you handle duplicate triplets in the result vector?
4. Are there any additional optimizations that can be applied to this solution?

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the given solution is O(n^2) due to the nested loops and linear sorting algorithm.
Space Complexity: The space complexity of the solution is O(1) for auxiliary space and O(n) for the result vector, where n is the size of the input array.
