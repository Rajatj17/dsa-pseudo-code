The given pseudocode is for finding the length of the highest mountain in a given array. A mountain in the array is defined as a sequence of consecutive integers where there is a peak and the integers to the left of the peak are in increasing order, and the integers to the right of the peak are in decreasing order.

Here are the main key points from the pseudocode:
1. Define a function `highest_mountain` that takes a vector of integers as input.
2. Initialize a variable `largest` to store the length of the highest mountain found.
3. Iterate through the array using a for loop, starting from the second element and ending at the second last element.
4. Check if the current element is a peak by comparing it with its previous and next elements.
5. If the current element is a peak, then initialize a counter `cnt` to 1 and iterate backwards to count the length of the mountain to the left of the peak and then iterate forwards to count the length of the mountain to the right of the peak.
6. Update the `largest` variable with the maximum mountain length found so far.
7. Continue the iteration until all elements are checked and return the `largest` value as the result.

For follow-up, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the logic behind counting the length of the mountain to the left and right of the peak?
2. Is there a more efficient way to solve this problem without iterating through the array multiple times?
3. Are there any edge cases or special scenarios that need to be considered while implementing this algorithm?

Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the number of elements in the input array
Space Complexity: O(1) - constant space is used, not dependent on the input size
