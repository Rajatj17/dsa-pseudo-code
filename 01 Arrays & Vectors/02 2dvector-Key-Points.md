The given code creates a 2D vector `arr` and initializes it with some values. It then updates the value of `arr[0][0]` by adding 10 to it. After that, it iterates through the vector and prints each element.

Here are the key points to solve the problem:
1. Initialize a 2D vector with given values.
2. Update a specific element in the 2D vector.
3. Iterate through the 2D vector and print its elements.

To follow-up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can:
1. Ask the interviewee to explain the usage of a 2D vector and its benefits over a normal array.
2. Inquire about the efficiency of the update operation on a specific element in the 2D vector.
3. Question the interviewee about the time complexity and space complexity of the provided code.

Time Complexity:
- Initializing the 2D vector: O(N*M), where N and M are the dimensions of the 2D vector.
- Updating a specific element: O(1)
- Iterating through the 2D vector and printing its elements: O(N*M), where N and M are the dimensions of the 2D vector.

Space Complexity:
- 2D vector: O(N*M), where N and M are the dimensions of the 2D vector.
- Additional space for variables and the output: O(1)

The interviewer can also discuss optimizations, error handling, and other ways to manipulate and access elements in a 2D vector.
