The given pseudocode is aimed at solving the subarray sort problem. The problem requires finding the indices of the smallest subarray which needs to be sorted in order to make the entire array sorted in ascending order.

1. Define a function `outOfOrder` which takes a vector `arr` and an index `i`, and determines if the element at index `i` is out of order by comparing it with its neighbors.

2. Implement the function `subarraySort` to iterate through the array and find the smallest and largest out-of-order elements.

3. Finally, find the indices where the smallest and largest out-of-order elements lie and return these indices as a pair.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include<algorithm>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool outOfOrder(vector<int> arr, int i){
    // implementation of outOfOrder function
}

pair<int,int> subarraySort(vector<int> arr) {
    // implementation of subarraySort function
}

int main() {
    // main function with sample input and function call
}
```

Interviewer can follow-up on this pseudo code by asking the following questions:
- How can we optimize the solution further in terms of time and space complexity?
- Can you modify the algorithm to handle duplicate elements in the array?
- What would be the impact of using a different comparison operator in the outOfOrder function?

Time Complexity: 
- The time complexity of the given pseudocode is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because the code iterates through the array only once to find the smallest and largest out-of-order elements.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for variables like `smallest`, `largest`, `left`, and `right`.
