The given pseudo code is implementing the solution to the problem of finding the amount of water that can be trapped between the bars given their heights.

Here are the key points of the pseudo code:
1. It defines a function called `trappedWater` which takes a vector of integers as input and returns an integer as output.
2. It initializes variables and checks for the base case where the number of bars is less than or equal to 2, in which case the function returns 0.
3. It uses two additional vectors to store the left maximum and right maximum heights of each bar.
4. It then calculates the amount of trapped water by iterating through the bars and summing up the minimum of left and right maximums minus the height of the current bar.
5. Finally, the function returns the total trapped water.

The interviewer can follow up on this pseudo code by asking the following questions:
1. Can you explain the purpose of using `left` and `right` vectors?
2. How does the algorithm calculate the amount of trapped water?
3. Can you provide an example and walk me through how the algorithm works step by step?
4. Can you optimize the algorithm further in terms of time or space complexity?
5. How would the algorithm perform if there are a large number of bars in the input?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the given solution is O(n) where n is the number of bars, as it iterates through the bars three times separately to calculate the left maximums, right maximums, and the trapped water.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the solution is O(n) as it uses two additional vectors of size n to store the left and right maximums of each bar.

It's always a good practice to analyze both time and space complexities of the algorithm.
