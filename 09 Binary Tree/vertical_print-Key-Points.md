The given code is for printing a binary tree in a vertical order. It uses a map to store the vertical order of nodes and then prints the nodes in each vertical line.

The following key points are needed to solve the problem:

1. The `node` class is defined to represent nodes of the binary tree.
2. The `buildTree` function builds a binary tree by taking input from the user.
3. The `levelOrderPrint` function prints the binary tree in level order traversal.
4. There is a `traverseTree` function which is a helper function for vertical order printing.
5. The `verticalOrderPrint` function prints the binary tree in a vertical order using a map to store the nodes in each vertical line.

To further understand the solution, the interviewer can follow-up with the following questions:
- Explain the use of the map data structure in the `verticalOrderPrint` function.
- Discuss the time and space complexity of the `verticalOrderPrint` function.
- Can you optimize the space complexity of the vertical order printing algorithm?

The time complexity of the `verticalOrderPrint` function is O(nlogn) where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the map data structure has a complexity of O(logn) for insertion and retrieval operations, and there will be n nodes in the tree.

The space complexity of the `verticalOrderPrint` function is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the space used by the map to store the vertical order of nodes will be proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.
