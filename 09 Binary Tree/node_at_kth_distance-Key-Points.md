The given code is for finding and printing all the nodes at a distance K from a given target node in a binary tree.

To achieve this, the following key points have been implemented:
1. The binary tree is built using the buildTree() function.

2. The levelOrderPrint() function is used to print the tree in level order traversal.

3. The printAtLevelK() function is designed to print the nodes at a particular level K from the given root node.

4. The printNodesAtDistanceK() function is used to find and print the nodes at a distance K from the target node. It uses a recursive approach to solve the problem.

5. In the main function, a sample binary tree is created, and a target node is specified. The distance K is also provided, and the printNodesAtDistanceK() function is called with the root, target, and distance K as parameters.

Following up on this pseudo code, an interviewer could ask the following questions:
1. Explain the logic behind building the binary tree using the buildTree() function.
2. Discuss the purpose of using the levelOrderPrint() function in the code.
3. Explain how the printAtLevelK() function works and its significance in the overall problem.
4. Describe the approach used in the printNodesAtDistanceK() function to find and print the nodes at a distance K from the target node.
5. Discuss the complexity of the implemented solution in terms of time and space.

Time Complexity: 
- The time complexity of building the binary tree is O(N) since each node is visited once during the tree construction.
- The time complexity of printing the nodes at a distance K is O(N) in the worst case, where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity for building the binary tree and levelOrderPrint() function is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as it utilizes a queue to handle the nodes at each level.
- The space complexity for printAtLevelK() and printNodesAtDistanceK() is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree, as the recursive calls are made for each level up to the target node.
