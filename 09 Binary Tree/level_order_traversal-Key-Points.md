The given code is for implementing a binary tree and performing a level order traversal to print the nodes at each level.

### Pseudo Code:
1. Create a `node` class with data, left, and right pointers for the binary tree structure.
2. Implement the `buildTree` function to create the binary tree by taking input from the user.
   - Start with the root node, then recursively build the left and right subtrees.
3. Implement the `levelOrderPrint` function to print the nodes at each level in level order.
   - Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
   - Push the root node into the queue.
   - While the queue is not empty, process each node by popping it and printing its data.
   - If the popped node has left and right children, push them into the queue.
   - Additionally, insert a NULL to signify the end of the current level and the start of the next level.

### How can the interviewer follow-up on this pseudo code?
1. Ask the interviewee to analyze the time complexity and space complexity of the implemented functions.
2. Question the interviewee about the different approaches to solve the problem of level order traversal.
3. Discuss alternative traversal methods like Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder, and their implementations in the context of a binary tree.
4. Prompt the interviewee to optimize the space complexity of the level order traversal function.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of `buildTree` function is O(N) because it visits each node once while constructing the binary tree.
- The time complexity of `levelOrderPrint` function is O(N) because it visits each node once while traversing the binary tree in level order.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of both functions is O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is due to the space used by the queue to store the nodes during level order traversal.
