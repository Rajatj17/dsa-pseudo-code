The given pseudocode defines a binary tree and implements two methods to find its diameter: a basic method and an optimized method. It also includes a method for a level order traversal of the binary tree.

1. The `node` class is defined with data, left, and right pointers for the binary tree nodes.

2. The `buildTree` function is a recursive function to build the binary tree using input from the user.

3. The `levelOrderPrint` function performs level order traversal of the binary tree and prints the elements at each level.

4. The `height` function calculates the height of the tree and is used in the calculation of the diameter.

5. The `diameter` function calculates the diameter of the tree using a basic approach.

6. The `optDiameter` function uses an optimized approach to calculate the diameter of the tree.

7. In the `main` function, a binary tree is built, and its level order traversal, as well as the diameters calculated using both basic and optimized methods, are printed.

To follow up on this pseudocode in an interview, the interviewer can ask the following questions:

1. Explain the process of building a binary tree using the `buildTree` function.

2. Describe how the `levelOrderPrint` function performs a level order traversal of the binary tree and discuss its time complexity.

3. Discuss the approach used in the `diameter` function and its time complexity. Also, explain how it can be optimized.

4. Explain the optimization technique used in the `optDiameter` function and how it improves the time complexity of the diameter calculation.

5. Analyze the time complexity and space complexity of the given pseudocode for building the binary tree, level order traversal, and diameter calculation.

Time Complexity:
- Building the binary tree: O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Level order traversal: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree since each node is visited once.
- Calculating diameter: O(n^2) in the basic approach and O(n) in the optimized approach, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

Space Complexity:
- Building the binary tree: O(n) for the recursive call stack.
- Level order traversal: O(n) for the queue to store nodes at each level.
- Calculating diameter: O(n) for the call stack in the basic approach and O(n) for the optimized approach.
