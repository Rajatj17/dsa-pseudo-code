The given code is for finding the maximum sum of a subset in a binary tree, where no two elements are adjacent.

1. The program creates a binary tree by taking input from the user and then prints the tree in a level-wise manner.
2. It uses a Pair class to store the inclusive and exclusive sum of a node, and then uses a recursive helper function maxSubsetSum to compute the maximum sum.

Here's a pseudo code to solve the MaxSubset Function:

```plaintext
maxSubsetSum(root):
    if root is NULL:
        return (0, 0)

    Left = maxSubsetSum(root->left)
    Right = maxSubsetSum(root->right)

    inc = root->data + Left.exc + Right.exc
    exc = max(Left.inc, Left.exc) + max(Right.inc, Right.exc)

    return (inc, exc)
```

To follow up on this pseudocode:
1. The interviewer can ask the candidate to explain the approach used to solve the problem.
2. The interviewer can ask how the Pair class is utilized to store the inclusive and exclusive sum of a node.
3. The interviewer can also ask the candidate to dry-run the given input to understand how the maxSubsetSum function is working.

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
Space Complexity: O(N), for the space used by the recursion stack.
