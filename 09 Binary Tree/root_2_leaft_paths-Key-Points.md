The given code is using a binary tree data structure to build a tree and then print all root to leaf paths. A binary tree is created using the `node` class. The `buildTree` function is used to build a binary tree by taking input from the user. 

The `levelOrderPrint` function is used to print the nodes of the binary tree level by level using a queue.

The main task is to complete the `printRoot2LeafPaths` function to print all root to leaf paths in the given binary tree.

The `printRoot2LeafPaths` function takes the root node and a vector to store the path. It recursively traverses the tree and prints the root to leaf paths as it encounters the leaf nodes.

To follow-up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. How would you modify the code to handle a binary tree with a different type of data in the nodes?
2. Can you think of an iterative approach to solve the problem of printing all root to leaf paths?
3. How would you modify the code to find and print the longest root to leaf path in the binary tree?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity for building a binary tree is O(n) because each node is visited once while building the tree.
- The time complexity for printing all root to leaf paths is also O(n) as each node is visited once to print the paths.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity for building a binary tree is O(n) due to the recursive calls and the memory used to store the tree nodes.
- The space complexity for printing all root to leaf paths is also O(n) due to the recursive calls and the space used to store the paths in the vector.
