To solve this problem, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Create a function `permute` that takes a string `a` and an integer `i` as parameters.
2. In the `permute` function, if `i` is equal to the length of the string `a`, then print the string `a`.
3. Otherwise, use a loop to iterate through each character in the string `a` starting from index `i`.
4. Swap the characters at index `i` and the current iterating index.
5. Recursively call the `permute` function with the updated string `a` and the incremented index.
6. Swap the characters back at index `i` and the current iterating index to backtrack the changes and continue the loop.


Here's the pseudo code for the above algorithm:

```plaintext
function permute(a, i):
    if i is equal to the length of string a:
        print a
    else:
        for j from i to length of string a:
            swap characters at index i and j in string a
            permute(a, i + 1)
            swap characters at index i and j in string a (backtrack)
```

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:

1. Can you explain the logic behind the recursive permutation function?
2. How does the swapping of characters work in the permutation algorithm?
3. Can you provide an example of the permutation algorithm in action for a specific input string?
4. How would you optimize the permutation algorithm for large input strings?

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the permutation algorithm is O(n!), where n is the length of the input string. This is because there are n! possible permutations of a string of length n.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is due to the recursive calls and the space required for the call stack.
