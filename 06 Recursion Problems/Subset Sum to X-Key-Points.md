The given code is for counting the number of subsets of the given array whose sum is equal to a given target sum X. The countSubsets function is using a recursive approach to solve this problem.

Here is the pseudo code for countSubsets function:
```plaintext
countSubsets(vector<int> arr, int n, int i, int X)
    if i equals n
        if X equals 0
            return 1
        return 0
    
    inc = countSubsets(arr, n, i + 1, X - arr[i])
    exc = countSubsets(arr, n, i + 1, X)
    return inc + exc
```

To follow up on this pseudo code in an interview, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. How does the recursive function countSubsets work?
2. Can you explain the base case and recursive case of the countSubsets function?
3. How does the function handle the inclusion and exclusion of elements from the subset?
4. Can you optimize the solution to improve its time complexity or space complexity?

Time Complexity: O(2^n) - where n is the size of the input array. The function recursively explores 2 options (including or excluding each element) for each element in the array, resulting in exponential time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(n) - The space used by the call stack during recursion, where n is the maximum depth of the recursion tree.
