The given code is an implementation of a Sudoku solver using backtracking algorithm.

Key points to solve the problem:
1. The `isSafe` function checks if it is safe to place a number in a given cell by checking the row, column, and subgrid for any conflicts.
2. The `solveSudoku` function is a recursive function which tries out all possibilities to fill the cells, and backtracks if a valid solution is not found.
3. The `main` function initializes the Sudoku grid and calls the `solveSudoku` function to solve the puzzle.

A possible follow-up question for the interviewer could be:
- Can you optimize the current implementation to make it more efficient?

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the provided solution is O(9^(n^2)) where n is the size of the Sudoku grid (in this case, 9 for a standard 9x9 grid). This is because for each empty cell, we try out up to 9 possibilities, and the depth of the recursion tree can go up to n^2 (total number of cells).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the given solution is O(n^2) as the recursive stack can go up to n^2 depth. Additionally, the Sudoku grid itself also contributes to the space complexity.
