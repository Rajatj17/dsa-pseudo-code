The given pseudocode solves the problem of finding the number of ways to climb 'n' steps by taking 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. 

It uses a recursive function countWays() that calculates the number of ways to reach the 'n-th' step by summing the number of ways to reach 'n-1', 'n-2', and 'n-3' steps recursively.

To follow up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can:
1. Ask the interviewer to explain how the countWays() function works and walk through an example with an input value of 'n'.
2. Ask the interviewer to analyze the time and space complexity of the countWays() function to assess its efficiency.
3. Discuss possible optimizations, such as memoization, to improve the performance of the countWays() function for large input values of 'n'.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the given pseudocode is O(3^n) due to the exponential growth in the number of recursive calls.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) where 'n' is the input value representing the number of steps, as it requires space for the recursive call stack.

By discussing the above aspects, an interviewer can gain insights into the candidate's understanding of recursion, time complexity analysis, and potential optimization techniques.
