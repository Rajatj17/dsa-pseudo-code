The given pseudo code is to find the length of the longest subarray with a sum equal to k. It uses an unordered map to keep track of the prefix sum and its corresponding index. It iterates through the array and keeps track of the length of the longest subarray with a sum equal to k.

The function takes a vector of integers as input and an integer k. It returns an integer which represents the length of the longest subarray with a sum equal to k.

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
- Can you explain how the unordered map is being used to keep track of the prefix sum and its corresponding index?
- How does the algorithm handle the case when the prefix sum equals k or when the difference between the prefix sum and k is found in the map?
- Can you provide some test cases to validate the correctness of the solution?

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the size of the input array.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the unordered map to store the prefix sum and its index.
