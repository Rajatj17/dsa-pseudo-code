The given code is attempting to break a cycle in a linked list. It uses a hash map to keep track of visited nodes and breaks the chain when a repeated node is found. However, there are a few issues with the provided code such as handling the case where there is no cycle and not properly updating the next pointer while traversing the list.

To fix the issues, the pseudo-code for breaking the cycle in the linked list can be written as follows:

```cpp
node * breakCycle(node * head) {
    node *slow = head;
    node *fast = head;

    // Detect cycle using Floyd's cycle detection algorithm
    while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
        if (slow == fast) {
            break;
        }
    }

    // If there is no cycle, return the original linked list
    if (fast == NULL || fast->next == NULL) {
        return head;
    }

    // Move one pointer to the start of the list and both pointers at the same speed until they meet
    slow = head;
    while (slow->next != fast->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next;
    }

    // Break the cycle
    fast->next = NULL;

    return head;
}
```

To follow up on this pseudo-code during an interview, an interviewer could ask the following questions:

1. Explain how the Floyd's cycle detection algorithm works.
2. How does the algorithm detect the presence of a cycle in a linked list?
3. Discuss the time and space complexity of the algorithm.

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the provided code is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the usage of a hash map to store visited nodes.

Following up on the pseudo-code, the interviewer can ask the candidate to provide a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of the algorithm, or to provide test cases to verify the correctness of the code.
