The given pseudocode is for the problem "Group Anagrams". Here are the key points from the pseudocode:

1. The input is a vector of strings, denoted by 'strs'.
2. The function 'groupAnagrams' returns a 2D vector, 'res', which contains groups of anagrams from the input vector.
3. It uses an unordered map, 'map', to store the sorted string as key and the index of the group in 'res' as value.
4. It iterates through each string in 'strs' and sorts each string to find its anagram group.

To follow-up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
- Can you explain the purpose of the unordered map in the code?
- What is the time complexity of the 'groupAnagrams' function?
- Can you provide an example input and the corresponding output for the function?

Time Complexity: O(n * m * log m), where n is the number of strings in the input vector and m is the maximum length of the strings.
Space Complexity: O(n * m), where n is the number of strings in the input vector and m is the maximum length of the strings.
