The given pseudocode is for finding the minimum number of bars in a given string `s` using a list of valid words `words` and the length of the string `n`.

The `min_bars_helper` function recursively searches for valid words from the current index in the string. It uses dynamic programming by storing the results for future recursion calls. If a valid word is found, it recursively calculates the minimum number of bars for the remaining string and returns the minimum value.

The `min_bars` function initializes an unordered set `m` with the valid words and then calls the `min_bars_helper` function to get the minimum number of bars required for the entire string `s`.

To follow-up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:

1. Can you explain the logic behind using the `unordered_set` to store valid words? How does it help in improving the time complexity of the solution?
2. How does the pseudocode handle the case where a valid word is not found in the set?
3. Can you explain the purpose of using `INT_MAX` and the value `-1` in the `min_bars_helper` function?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `min_bars_helper` function is O(2^n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because at each step, the function explores two possibilities: continuing with the current prefix or moving to the next character.
- The time complexity of the `min_bars` function is also O(2^n), as it calls the helper function and performs similar operations.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the solution is O(n) due to the recursive calls, where n is the length of the string `s`. Additionally, the space complexity is O(k) for the unordered set `m`, where k is the number of valid words in the input list `words`.
