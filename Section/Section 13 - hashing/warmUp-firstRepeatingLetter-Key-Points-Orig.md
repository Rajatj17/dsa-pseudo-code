The given code is a C++ function that takes a string as input and returns the first repeated character in the input string using an unordered map to keep track of the characters encountered.

Here are the key points to solve the problem:
1. The function firstRepeatChar takes a string input as a parameter.
2. It initializes an unordered map to store characters encountered in the input string.
3. It iterates through each character in the input string and checks if it is already present in the unordered map.
4. If a character is not present in the map, it adds it to the map.
5. If a character is already present in the map, it returns the character as the first repeated character.
6. If no repeated character is found, it returns a null character '\0'.

To follow-up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you provide an example input and the expected output of the function?
2. How would you modify this code to handle uppercase and lowercase characters as the same character?
3. Can you analyze the time and space complexity of the given code?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the given code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the code iterates through each character of the input string once and performs constant time operations with the unordered map.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the given code is O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the input string and m is the number of unique characters in the input string. This is because the unordered map stores unique characters encountered in the input string. If m is smaller than n, the space complexity is O(m); otherwise, it is O(n).
