The given code defines a function `commonElements` that takes two vectors as input and returns a vector containing the common elements between the two input vectors. The function achieves this by first sorting both input vectors and then using a hash map to identify and store the common elements.

Key points to solve the problem:
1. Sort the input vectors `v1` and `v2` in ascending order.
2. Create a hash map to store the elements of `v1` as keys and set their values to true.
3. Traverse through `v2`, if an element exists in the map, add it to the result vector `v`.

Interviewer can follow-up on this pseudo code by asking:
- How would you handle duplicate elements in the input vectors?
- Can you improve the solution further in terms of time complexity?

Time Complexity: O(m log m + n log n), where m and n are the sizes of the input vectors v1 and v2 respectively due to sorting, and O(min(m, n)) for iterating through the sorted vectors.
Space Complexity: O(m) for the hash map where m is the size of the first input vector v1.
