The given pseudocode consists of two functions `powerModulo` and `solve`. The `solve` function is a recursive function that calculates the modular exponentiation of base `A`, exponent `B`, and modulus `C` using a divide and conquer approach. The function `powerModulo` sets the modulus value and calls the `solve` function with the given base and exponent values.

To follow up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Explain the purpose of the `solve` function and how it calculates the modular exponentiation.
2. Can you explain the logic behind the recursion in the `solve` function?
3. How does the `powerModulo` function use the `solve` function to calculate the result?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `solve` function is O(log B) as it uses a divide and conquer approach to calculate the modular exponentiation.
- The time complexity of the `powerModulo` function is the same as the `solve` function since it just sets the modulus value and calls the `solve` function.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the `solve` function is O(log B) as it uses recursion and maintains the call stack.
- The space complexity of the `powerModulo` function is O(1) as there is no additional space used.

Overall, the time complexity of the given pseudocode is O(log B) and the space complexity is O(log B) due to the recursive nature of the `solve` function.
