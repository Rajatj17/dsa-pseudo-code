The given pseudocode is used to find the maximum possible value of a subarray of length at most k that can be removed from the given array.

Key points to solve the problem:
1. The function `sum` calculates the sum of elements in the given range [i, j) of the array.
2. The function `calc` recursively calculates the maximum possible value by considering all possible subarray combinations and their removal.
3. The main function `MaxValue` calls the `calc` function to find the maximum possible value after removing a subarray of length at most k.

Follow-up questions for the interviewer:
1. Would you like to optimize the solution for better time complexity or space complexity?
2. Are there any constraints on the input array size or the value of k?
3. Can the input array contain negative numbers?
4. How do you plan to use the result of the maximum possible value in your application?

Time complexity: The time complexity of the given solution is O(n * k^2), where n is the size of the input array and k is the given value.
Space complexity: The space complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the input array, due to the recursive calls and the size of the input array.
