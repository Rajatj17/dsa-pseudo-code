The given code is a C++ implementation to solve the N-Queens problem using recursive backtracking.

Key points to solve the N-Queens problem:
1. The `isSafe` function is used to check if it is safe to place a queen in a particular position.
2. It checks for conflicts in row, column, and both diagonals for previously placed queens.
3. The `solve` function is a recursive backtracking function that tries to place queens on the board for each row, and if successful, moves to the next row. It backtracks if no valid position is found for the current row.
4. The `nQueen` function initializes a 2D array to represent the chessboard and then calls the `solve` function to find the total number of distinct solutions for placing N queens on an NxN chessboard.

To follow-up on this:
- The interviewer can ask the candidate to explain the backtracking approach used in the `solve` function.
- They can discuss optimizations or improvements to the existing code, such as reducing the space complexity or handling larger board sizes efficiently.
- The interviewer can ask the candidate to provide a detailed walkthrough of how the `nQueen` function works for a specific N value.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the given code is O(N!), where N is the number of queens (or the size of the chessboard). This is because the recursive backtracking function `solve` explores all possible configurations and has a branching factor of N.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(N^2) as the code uses an NxN 2D array to represent the chessboard.

Follow-up on Pseudocode:
1. How would you modify the code to print all distinct solutions for placing N queens on an NxN chessboard?
2. Can you optimize the code to reduce the space complexity while still solving the N-Queens problem efficiently?

These follow-up questions can help gauge the candidate's understanding of the problem and their ability to improve the given pseudocode.
