The provided pseudocode generates all possible permutations of the input string and returns them in lexicographically sorted order using backtracking.

The function `find_Permutations` is used to find all permutations of the input string `inp` and store them in the global vector `v`. It recursively generates permutations by swapping characters at different positions and backtracking.

The function `findSortedPermutations` takes the input string `s` and converts it to a character array `inp`. It then calls the `find_Permutations` function to find all permutations and stores them in the set `st` to remove duplicates. Finally, it populates the vector `v` with the sorted unique permutations and returns it.

### Follow-up:
To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can discuss the following points:
1. The approach used to find permutations and whether there are any alternative methods for generating permutations.
2. The time and space complexity of the provided solution.
3. The possibility of improving the efficiency of the code and reducing redundant operations.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of generating all permutations using backtracking is O(n!), where n is the length of the input string. The time complexity of sorting the permutations is O(n log n), where n is the number of permutations.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the provided solution is O(n!), where n is the length of the input string, due to the storage of all unique permutations in the vector. Additionally, the space complexity of storing the set of unique permutations is O(n!), considering the worst case scenario.
