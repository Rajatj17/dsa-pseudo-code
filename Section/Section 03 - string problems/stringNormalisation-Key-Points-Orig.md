The given pseudocode defines three functions - `skip_whitespace`, `normalize_word`, and `normalize`. The `skip_whitespace` function skips all the whitespaces in the input sentence until a non-whitespace character is encountered. The `normalize_word` function converts the first letter of a word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase. The `normalize` function applies the `skip_whitespace` and `normalize_word` functions to normalize the entire sentence.

To follow up on this pseudocode in an interview, the interviewer can ask questions related to:
1. The purpose of each function
2. How the functions are used to achieve the goal of normalization
3. Potential edge cases or error handling
4. Time and space complexity of each function
5. Suggestions for optimization or improvements

For Time Complexity and Space Complexity:
- `skip_whitespace` function:
   - Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input sentence
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

- `normalize_word` function:
   - Time Complexity: O(m) where m is the length of a word
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

- `normalize` function:
   - Time Complexity: O(n*m) where n is the number of words and m is the average length of a word
   - Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input sentence
