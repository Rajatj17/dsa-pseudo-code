The given pseudo code defines a function `convert_to_digital_time` that takes in minutes as input and converts it to a digital time format (HH:MM). It calculates the hours and minutes from the given input and then converts them to strings, concatenating them to form the time in digital format.

To follow-up on this pseudo code during an interview, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the purpose of using the modulus operator in this code?
2. Why is it necessary to convert the minutes to a two-digit format if it's less than 10?
3. Is there a more efficient way to achieve the same result without using string concatenation?

Time Complexity: O(1) - The time complexity of this function is constant as it performs a fixed number of arithmetic operations and string manipulations, regardless of the input size.

Space Complexity: O(1) - The space complexity of this function is also constant as it only uses a few integer variables and string variables, and does not depend on the input size.

These questions and complexities can help understand the efficiency and scalability of the given pseudo code.
