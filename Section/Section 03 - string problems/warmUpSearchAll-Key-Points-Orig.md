The provided code defines a function `stringSearch` that takes in two strings, `big` and `small`, and returns a vector of integers representing the indices where the `small` string is found within the `big` string. The function uses the `find` method to search for occurrences of the `small` string within the `big` string, and it continues searching for occurrences after each found index.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask for the following points:
1. The logic of the function and how it finds the occurrences of the `small` string within the `big` string using the `find` method.
2. How the function handles multiple occurrences of the `small` string within the `big` string by continuing the search for occurrences after each found index.
3. Edge cases that need to be considered, such as when the `small` string is empty or when it is not found within the `big` string.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the `stringSearch` function is O(n*m), where n is the length of the `big` string and m is the length of the `small` string. This is because the `find` method, which has a time complexity of O(n), is potentially called multiple times, depending on the number of occurrences of the `small` string within the `big` string.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity of the `stringSearch` function is O(k), where k is the number of occurrences of the `small` string within the `big` string. This is because the function maintains a vector `result` to store the indices of the occurrences.
