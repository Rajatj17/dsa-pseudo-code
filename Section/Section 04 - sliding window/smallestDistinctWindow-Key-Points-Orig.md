The given pseudo code is implementing a function to find the smallest window in a given string that contains all distinct characters of the string.

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:

1. Can you explain the main idea behind the algorithm used in the smallestWindow function?
2. What is the purpose of the visited array and how is it being used in the code?
3. Why is the start_index initialized to -1 and min_len initialized to INT_MAX?
4. How does the code handle the process of finding the smallest window containing all distinct characters?
5. Can you explain the purpose of the curr_count array and how it is being used in the code?
6. Explain with an example how this function will work for a given input string.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the smallestWindow function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the function iterates through the string only once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the smallestWindow function is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. This is because the size of the arrays and variables used in the function (such as visited, curr_count, start_index, min_len, etc.) remains constant.
