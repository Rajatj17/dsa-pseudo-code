The given code implements a function `cntSubarrays` that takes a vector of integers `arr` and an integer `sum` as input and returns the count of subarrays in `arr` whose sum equals the given `sum`. It uses an unordered map `prevSum` to keep track of the cumulative sum of subarrays and their occurrences.

Here are the key points to solve the problem:
1. Initialize variables `prevSum` as an unordered map, `n` as the size of the input array `arr`, and `res` as the count of subarrays.
2. Iterate through the elements of `arr` and maintain the current sum of elements encountered so far.
3. If the current sum is equal to the desired sum, increment the count of subarrays by 1.
4. If the difference between the current sum and the given sum exists in the `prevSum` map, update the count of subarrays by adding the occurrences of the difference in the map to the result.
5. Keep updating the occurrences of the current sum in the `prevSum` map.

To follow up on the pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. How does the code handle negative numbers in the input array?
2. Is there any possibility of integer overflow in the cumulative sum calculation?
3. How would you handle edge cases such as an empty input array or a sum of 0?

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the provided solution is O(n) where n is the size of the input array `arr`. The solution iterates through the array once and uses constant time operations for each element.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the solution is O(n) where n is the size of the input array `arr`. This is due to the usage of the unordered map `prevSum` to store the cumulative sum and their occurrences.
