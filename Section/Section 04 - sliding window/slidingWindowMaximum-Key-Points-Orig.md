The given code performs a sliding window maximum operation and returns a vector of maximum values for each window of size k in the given input array. The implementation uses a deque data structure to efficiently find and update the maximum elements in the sliding window.

Key Points:
1. The function maxInWindow takes a vector of integers 'a' and an integer 'k' as input, where 'a' is the input array and 'k' is the size of the sliding window.
2. It initializes a deque 'Q' of size 'k' to store the indices of elements within the sliding window.
3. The first loop processes the first 'k' elements by maintaining a decreasing deque. It ensures that the front of the deque contains the index of the maximum element within the current window.
4. The second loop processes the remaining elements by adding the maximum element to the output vector, removing elements from the front of the deque that are outside the current window, and maintaining the decreasing order of elements in the deque.
5. The final maximum element is added to the output vector after processing all elements.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Explain the purpose of using a deque data structure in this context.
2. Can you explain the time complexity of the maxInWindow function?
3. How does the sliding window technique help in solving this problem?
4. Can you provide specific examples to illustrate the functioning of the algorithm and its output?

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the maxInWindow function is O(n) where 'n' is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the algorithm processes each element of the array only once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the maxInWindow function is O(n) where 'n' is the number of elements in the input array. This is due to the storage of the output vector and the deque, which can grow up to 'n' elements in the worst case.
