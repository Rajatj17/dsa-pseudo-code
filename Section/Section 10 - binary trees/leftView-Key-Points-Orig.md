This C++ code defines a binary tree and a function to get the left view of the tree. The left view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the left side.

1. The code defines a class `Node` which represents a node in the binary tree.

2. The `leftViewUtil` function is a recursive utility function that traverses the tree in preorder fashion and keeps track of the maximum level seen so far. It adds the first node encountered at each level to the result vector.

3. The `leftView` function initializes `max_level` to 0 and calls the `leftViewUtil` function to compute the left view of the tree.

To follow-up on the pseudocode, an interviewer could ask the following questions:

1. How can you modify the code to get the right view of the binary tree?
2. Can you provide an iterative solution for the left view of the binary tree?
3. How would you handle edge cases such as an empty tree input?
4. Can you provide an example and walk through how the code would behave on that example?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the code visits each node once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is O(h) where h is the height of the binary tree. This is because the code uses recursive calls that are proportional to the height of the tree. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case for a skewed tree and O(log n) in the average case for a balanced tree.
