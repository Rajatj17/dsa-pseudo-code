The given C++ code defines a binary tree node and implements a function to check if two given binary trees are equal or not. The code first defines a Node class with a key value, a left child, and a right child. The equal() function is then implemented to recursively check if the two given binary trees are structurally and node-wise equal.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask the following questions:

1. Can you explain the logic behind the equal() function?
2. How does the equal() function handle the case when one of the trees is empty?
3. Can you provide an example to demonstrate the working of the equal() function?
4. How would you test the equal() function for various scenarios and edge cases?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the equal() function is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary trees. This is because the function needs to recursively check each corresponding node in both trees.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the equal() function is O(h), where h is the height of the binary trees. This is because the recursive calls consume space on the call stack, and the space used depends on the height of the trees.

Overall, the space complexity also depends on the implementation of the binary trees and the input provided.

By analyzing the time and space complexity of the code, an interviewer can assess the efficiency of the equal() function in handling large binary trees and how it utilizes memory for recursive calls.
