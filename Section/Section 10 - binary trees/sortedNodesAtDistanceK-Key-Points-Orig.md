The given pseudo code is for finding all nodes at a distance K from a target node in a binary tree. It defines a class `node` for the binary tree and includes a function `nodesAtDistanceK` to find the nodes at distance K from a given target node.

Key points to solve the problem:
1. The `printAtLevelK` function is used to find all nodes at a specific level K from the root node.
2. The `printNodesAtDistanceK` function is a recursive function to print nodes at distance K from the given target node. It recursively moves to the left and right subtrees to find the target node and then prints the nodes at distance K accordingly.
3. The `nodesAtDistanceK` function initiates the process and returns a sorted vector of nodes at distance K from the target node.

A follow-up question for the interviewer could be: Can you optimize the algorithm further in terms of time or space complexity?

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the given solution is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because in the worst case, the algorithm may need to traverse all the nodes to find the nodes at distance K.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the given solution is O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This is because the recursive calls can go as deep as the height of the tree, occupying space on the call stack.
