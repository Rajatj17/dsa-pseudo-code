Key points to solve the problem:

1. Create a Graph class with an adjacency list representation and a method to add edges.

2. Implement a method in the Graph class to find the minimum cost using BFS algorithm to reach from source node to destination node.

3. Create a min_dice_throws function that takes the number of cells, snakes positions, and ladders positions as input.

4. Convert board to graph representation, where the snakes and ladders will form edges in the graph.

5. Iterate over each cell, and for each dice throw, add an edge to the graph from that cell to the next cell based on the dice value.

6. Call the minCostBFS method of the Graph class to find the minimum cost to reach from the first cell to the last cell.

Follow-up:

To follow-up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:

1. Can you explain the logic behind using BFS algorithm to find the minimum cost of reaching from source to destination?

2. How would you handle any edge cases or special scenarios in the given problem?

3. Can you optimize the code further in terms of time complexity or space complexity?

4. Can you provide test cases or examples to validate the correctness of the solution?

Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(N) for creating the graph and O(V+E) for BFS traversal, where N is the number of cells and V, E are the vertices and edges in the graph.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(N) for the board vector and O(V) for the adjacency list representation of the graph, where N is the number of cells and V is the number of vertices in the graph.
