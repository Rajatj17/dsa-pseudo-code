The given code represents a class Graph and a function contains_cycle to check if a graph contains a cycle or not.

### Key Points:
1. The Graph class represents an undirected graph using an adjacency list.
2. The addEdge method is used to add an edge between two vertices in the graph.
3. The cycle_helper method is a recursive function that uses DFS to detect cycles in the graph.
4. The contains_cycle method initializes an array of visited nodes and calls the cycle_helper method to check for cycles in the graph.
5. The contains_cycle function outside the class takes a vector of edges and uses the Graph class to check if the graph contains a cycle.

### How can a interviewer follow-up on this pseudo code:
1. Discuss the time and space complexity of the cycle detection algorithm.
2. Explore different approaches to detect cycles in a graph, such as using disjoint sets or Tarjan's algorithm.
3. Discuss scenarios where detecting cycles in a graph is important and how it impacts various applications.
4. Ask to implement additional graph algorithms, such as finding shortest paths or determining the connected components of the graph.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of detecting cycles in a graph using Depth First Search (DFS) is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the given code is O(V + E) for the adjacency list and O(V) for the visited array, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
