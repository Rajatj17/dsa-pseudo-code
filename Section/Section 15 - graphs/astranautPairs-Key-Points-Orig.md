The provided code is for finding the number of pairs of astronauts from the given list who are from different countries. It uses the concepts of Graph and Depth First Search (DFS) to find the solution.

Key Points:
1. A Graph class is defined with the functionality to add edges between astronauts and count the astronauts from different countries using DFS.
2. The count_pairs function initializes a Graph and adds edges for each pair of astronauts. It then calls the countAstronauts method of the Graph class to get the count of astronauts from different countries.

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the working of the countAstronauts method in the Graph class?
2. How does the DFS algorithm help in solving the problem of counting astronauts from different countries?
3. Can you provide an example to demonstrate the working of the count_pairs function with a sample input?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the count_pairs function mainly depends on the countAstronauts method of the Graph class, which uses DFS. The overall time complexity is O(V + E) for creating the graph and traversing it, where V is the number of astronauts and E is the number of astronaut pairs.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(V + E) for creating the graph, where V is the number of astronauts and E is the number of astronaut pairs. Additionally, space is used for maintaining the visited array during DFS traversal.
