The given code is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a given grid. It uses a set to maintain the nodes with their distances from the source and updates the distances of neighbors while traversing the grid.

The main function `shortest_path` takes a 2D grid of integers (`vector<vector<int>> grid`) as input and returns the shortest distance from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

Here are the key points of the code:
1. The code initializes the distance matrix and a set to store nodes with their distances.
2. It implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in the grid using the set to maintain the minimum distance.

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Explain how Dijkstra's algorithm works and why it is used in this context.
2. What is the purpose of the `Node` class and the `Compare` class?
3. Can you explain the purpose of the set in this implementation and why it is being used?
4. How does the code handle updating the distances and nodes in the set while traversing the grid?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O((V + E)logV), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- In this specific implementation, the time complexity would be O((m*n)log(m*n)), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the code is O(m*n) for the distance matrix and the set used to store nodes with distances.

By asking these questions, an interviewer can assess the candidate's understanding of graph algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills.
