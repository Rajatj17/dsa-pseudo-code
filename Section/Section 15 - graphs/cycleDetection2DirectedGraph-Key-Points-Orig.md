The given code defines a class `Graph`, which is used to check for cycles in a directed graph. The `Graph` class has methods to add edges and to check for cycles by using a helper function `cycle_helper`.

The `cycle_helper` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to check for cycles in the graph. It maintains two boolean arrays `visited` and `stack` to keep track of visited nodes and the current recursion stack. If a node is already in the stack, then a cycle is found and the function returns true. Otherwise, if the neighbor is not visited, it recursively calls `cycle_helper` for the neighbor node.

The `contains_cycle` function takes a vector of edges as input and creates a `Graph` object to add the edges and then checks for cycles using the `contains_cycle` method of the `Graph` class.

The `contains_cycle` function returns true if the graph contains a cycle and false otherwise.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Explain the purpose of the `cycle_helper` function in the code.
2. Discuss the use of boolean arrays `visited` and `stack` in the `cycle_helper` function.
3. Can you explain how the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm is used to detect cycles in the graph?
4. How does the `contains_cycle` function use the `Graph` class to check for cycles in the given graph?

Time Complexity:
- Adding an edge in `Graph` class: O(1)
- Checking for cycles using DFS: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

Space Complexity:
- In the `Graph` class: O(V + E) to store the graph using adjacency list.
- In the `contains_cycle` function: O(V) for the boolean arrays `visited` and `stack`.

Overall, the time complexity is O(V + E) for checking cycles and the space complexity is O(V + E) to store the graph.
