The given code defines a class "node" for a linked list, and a function "isPresent" to check if a given key is present in the linked list. The "isPresent" function iterates through the linked list and returns true if the key is found, otherwise it returns false.

To improve the efficiency of finding kth last element, we can use a two-pointer approach: one pointer moves k positions ahead and then the second pointer starts. When the first pointer reaches the end, the second pointer will be at kth last element.

```cpp
node* kthLastElement(node * head, int k){
    node *slow = head;
    node *fast = head;
    
    for(int i=0; i<k; i++){
        if(fast == NULL){
            return NULL; // return NULL if k is greater than the length of the list
        }
        fast = fast->next;
    }
    
    while(fast != NULL){
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next;
    }
    
    return slow;
}
```

For someone looking to understand the pseudo code, the following steps can be taken:
1. Walk through the given code to understand the existing "isPresent" function.
2. Discuss the concept of finding kth last element using two pointers approach.
3. Review the provided pseudo code for "kthLastElement" and ensure understanding of its functionality.

To follow up on the pseudo code:
- The interviewer can ask for a demonstration with a sample linked list and a value of k to show how the function returns kth last element.
- The interviewer can also discuss different test cases and edge cases to verify the correctness and robustness of the pseudo code.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the given "isPresent" function to find a key in the linked list is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. The time complexity of the "kthLastElement" function using the two pointers approach is also O(n), as it iterates through the linked list once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of both the "isPresent" and "kthLastElement" functions is O(1), as they do not use any extra space that grows with the input size.
