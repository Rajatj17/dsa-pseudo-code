The given code is for detecting a cycle in a linked list using Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. Here are the key points in the code:
1. The code consists of a `node` class representing a node in a linked list which contains an integer data and a pointer to the next node.
2. The function `containsCycle` takes the head of the linked list as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the linked list contains a cycle.
3. Inside the `containsCycle` function, two pointers `slow` and `fast` are initialized to the head of the linked list.
4. The while loop moves the `slow` pointer by one step and the `fast` pointer by two steps at each iteration.
5. If at any point, `slow` becomes equal to `fast`, it means there is a cycle in the linked list and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

To follow-up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Explain the working of Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm and how it is applied in the given code.
2. How can you modify this code to return the starting point of the cycle in the linked list, if it exists?
3. Discuss the time and space complexity of the `containsCycle` function.

Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm will traverse the linked list at most twice, so the time complexity is linear.
Space Complexity: O(1) - the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for the two pointers `slow` and `fast`, regardless of the size of the linked list.
