## Problem Statement
You are given a singly linked list and an integer k. You need to write a function `kthLastElement` to find the kth last element of the linked list.

### Input
- A pointer to the head of the linked list, `head`.
- An integer `k` representing the position of the element to be found from the end of the linked list.

### Output
Return the kth last element of the linked list.

## Example
``` 
Input:
head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
k = 2
Output:
4

Input:
head = 3 -> 1 -> 7 -> 9 -> 2 -> NULL
k = 3
Output:
