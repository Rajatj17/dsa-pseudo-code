The provided C++ code defines a function `productArray` that takes a vector of integers `arr` as input and returns a new vector containing the product of all elements in `arr`, except the element at the corresponding index. The time complexity of the code is O(N) and the space complexity is O(N).

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can consider asking the following questions:
1. Can you walk through the logic of the `productArray` function and explain how it computes the product array?
2. How does the use of two loops help in computing the product array efficiently?
3. Can you explain why the base case returns a vector containing a single element whose value is 0?
4. How would you handle edge cases, such as an empty input array or an array containing only one element?

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
