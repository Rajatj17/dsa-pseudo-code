The given pseudo code represents a function to find the maximum subarray sum using the Kadane's algorithm. Here are the key points to solve the problem:

1. Initialize variables `cs` (current sum) and `ms` (maximum sum) to 0.
2. Iterate through the input array `arr` and:
   a. Add the current element to the current sum `cs`.
   b. Update the maximum sum `ms` using the `max` function.
   c. If the current sum `cs` becomes negative, reset it to 0.
3. Return the maximum sum `ms` as the result.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the Kadane's algorithm and how it is utilized in this pseudo code?
2. Can you provide an example input array and walk through the execution of the pseudo code step by step?
3. What are the time and space complexities of this function?

Time Complexity: O(n) - The function iterates through the input array once, where n is the size of the input array.
Space Complexity: O(1) - The function uses a constant amount of extra space for the variables `cs` and `ms`, regardless of the input size.
