Sure, here are the key points to solve the problem:

1. Create a function `fizzbuzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a vector of strings.
2. Initialize an empty vector `result` to store the output.
3. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to `n`.
4. Inside the loop, check if the current number is divisible by both 3 and 5 using the condition `(i%15)==0`, if true, add "FizzBuzz" to the result vector.
5. If not, check if the number is divisible by 5 using the condition `i%5 == 0`, if true, add "Buzz" to the result vector.
6. If not, check if the number is divisible by 3 using the condition `i%3 == 0`, if true, add "Fizz" to the result vector.
7. If none of the above conditions are true, convert the number to a string using `to_string(i)` and add it to the result vector.
8. Finally, return the result vector.

To follow up on this pseudocode, the interviewer can discuss the approach with the candidate to understand their thought process and reasoning behind using a particular method. They can also ask the candidate to write the actual code, test it with different input values, and analyze its correctness and efficiency.

Time Complexity: O(n) - The time complexity of the fizzbuzz function is O(n) where n is the input integer. This is because the function uses a single for loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to n, and the operations inside the loop are constant time.

Space Complexity: O(n) - The space complexity of the function is also O(n) as it creates a vector to store the output strings, and the size of the vector is directly proportional to the input integer n.
