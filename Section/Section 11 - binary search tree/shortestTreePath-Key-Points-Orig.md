The given code is using a binary tree data structure to find the shortest distance between two nodes in the given tree. It is using the concept of Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) to find the distance between the two nodes. This is achieved by finding the LCA of the two input nodes and then calculating the distance by finding the levels of the nodes from the LCA.

The key points to solve this problem are:
1. Define a "node" class to represent the nodes of the binary tree, with integer key, left, and right pointers.
2. Implement a function to find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in the binary tree.
3. Implement a function to find the level of a given node from the root node or any given node in the binary tree.
4. Use the LCA and level finding functions to calculate the shortest distance between two given nodes in the binary tree.

To follow up on this pseudocode, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. How does the LCA function work and what is its time complexity?
2. What is the purpose of the search function, and how is the level of a node calculated using it?
3. Why is the sum of the levels of the two nodes from their LCA equal to the shortest distance between them?
4. Can you walk me through an example using this code to find the shortest distance between two nodes in a binary tree?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of finding the LCA in a binary tree is O(n) in the worst-case scenario, where 'n' is the number of nodes in the tree. The time complexity of finding the levels of two nodes and calculating their distance is also O(n) in the worst-case scenario.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the given code is O(h), where 'h' is the height of the binary tree, due to the recursive nature of the functions and the stack space used for recursion.

By discussing these questions, the interviewer can evaluate the candidate's understanding of binary tree traversal, LCA, and distance calculation as well as their understanding of time and space complexity.
