The given pseudocode is for finding the in-order successor of a node in a binary search tree.

The findInOrderSuccessor function takes a Node pointer as input and returns the in-order successor of that node.

The logic is as follows:
1. If the input node has a right child, then the in-order successor will be the leftmost node of its right subtree.
2. If the input node does not have a right child, then the in-order successor will be the first parent node for which the input node is in the left subtree.

To follow-up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the logic behind finding the in-order successor in a binary search tree?
2. Can you walk through an example of finding the in-order successor for a specific node in a binary search tree?
3. How would you handle edge cases such as when the input node is the maximum node in the tree?
4. Can you determine the time and space complexity of this code?

Time Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the binary search tree.
Space Complexity: O(1) since the code only uses a constant amount of extra space.
