The given pseudo code contains a C++ class `Node` and a method `isPresent` to check for the presence of a key in a binary search tree.

Key points to solve the problem:
1. A `Node` class is defined with key value, left and right pointers for the binary tree node.
2. The `isPresent` method takes a root node of a binary search tree and a target key as input and returns true if the key is present in the tree, otherwise it returns false.
3. In the `isPresent` method, it checks if the root is NULL, if it is, then it returns false.
4. If the key of the root node matches the target key, it returns true.
5. If the target key is less than the key of the root node, then it recursively calls `isPresent` on the left subtree.
6. Otherwise, it recursively calls `isPresent` on the right subtree.

To follow-up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the working of the `isPresent` method with an example?
2. How would you write test cases to validate the correctness of the `isPresent` method?
3. Can you provide the iterative implementation of the `isPresent` method?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the `isPresent` method in the worst case is O(h), where h is the height of the binary search tree.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the `isPresent` method is O(h), where h is the height of the binary search tree, due to the recursive calls.
