The given pseudo code is an implementation of a function to check whether a given binary tree is a Binary Search Tree (BST) or not. It uses the concept of validating the left and right subtrees of each node against certain constraints.

Here are the key points:
1. A Node class is defined to represent the nodes of the binary tree.
2. The class includes 'key' to store the node's value and pointers to 'left' and 'right' child nodes.
3. The 'isBSTUtil' function is a helper function that recursively checks whether the given binary tree (rooted at 'node') is a valid BST or not, based on a range of values allowed for each node.
4. It uses the concept of range validation for each node, where the left child should have a value less than the parent and the right child should have a value greater than the parent, within the given range.
5. The 'isBST' function calls the 'isBSTUtil' function with initial range constraints (INT_MIN and INT_MAX) which represents negative infinity and positive infinity.

To follow up on this pseudo code in an interview, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the purpose of the 'isBSTUtil' function and how it works?
2. How does the range-based validation ensure that the binary tree is a BST?
3. Can you walk through an example of how the 'isBST' function would validate a binary tree as a BST?
4. Are there any specific edge cases that need to be considered for this implementation?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the 'isBST' and 'isBSTUtil' functions is O(n), where 'n' is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited once during the validation process.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(h), where 'h' is the height of the binary tree. This is due to the recursive nature of the algorithm, which incurs space on the function call stack proportional to the height of the tree. In the worst case, for a skewed tree, the space complexity could be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).
