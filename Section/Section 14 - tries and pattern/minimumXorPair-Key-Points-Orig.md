Here is the pseudocode for finding the maximum XOR pair in a given array using a trie data structure:

```plaintext
1. Create a node class with left and right pointers.
2. Create a trie class with a root node.
3. Implement an insert method in the trie class to insert bits of a number into the trie.
4. Implement a max_xor_helper method in the trie class to find the maximum XOR value for a given number.
5. Implement a max_xor method in the trie class to loop through the input array, insert each number into the trie, and find the maximum XOR value.
6. Create a function max_xor_pair that initializes a trie and calls the max_xor method to find the maximum XOR pair in the input array.
```

Following up with the interviewer:

To follow up on this pseudocode, the interviewer can ask for a step-by-step explanation of the code and its functionality. Additionally, the interviewer can explore potential optimizations or modifications to the code, such as handling edge cases or improving the overall efficiency.

Time Complexity: 
- The time complexity of inserting each number into the trie is O(32n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
- The time complexity of finding the maximum XOR value for each number is also O(32n).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity of the max_xor_pair function is O(32n).

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the trie data structure is O(32n) to store the bits of each number in the input array.
- Therefore, the overall space complexity of the max_xor_pair function is O(32n).
