Sure, here are the key points to solve the problem:

1. We are given a string 's' and we need to find the first non-repeating character in the string.
2. We can use a queue to store the characters that we encounter in the string and an array to keep track of the frequency of each character.
3. We iterate through the string, and for each character, we push it into the queue and update its frequency in the array.
4. We then check the front of the queue, and if its frequency is greater than 1, we pop it from the queue. If its frequency is 1, we add it to the result vector and break the loop.
5. If the queue becomes empty before finding a non-repeating character, we add '0' to the result vector.

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask:
- How would you test this code with different inputs and edge cases to ensure its correctness?
- Can you optimize this code further in terms of time or space complexity?
- Can you provide the time and space complexity of the solution for analysis?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through the string once, and for each character, the queue operations and frequency updates take constant time.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of this solution is O(1) for the array of size 26 to store the frequency, and O(n) for the queue to store the characters. Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).
