The given code implements a solution to find the number of combinations to make the given sum using the given coins. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Key points:
1. The function `coinChange` takes the target sum `s`, the index of the current coin `n`, the vector of coins `a`, and a 2D dynamic programming array `dp` as parameters.
2. It returns the number of combinations to make the sum `s` using the coins from index 0 to `n`.
3. If the target sum becomes less than 0 or the number of coins becomes less than 0, it returns 0.
4. If the target sum becomes 0, it returns 1 (as there is 1 way to make the sum).
5. It uses memoization to store the results for a particular target sum and coin index, and if already calculated, directly returns the value from the memoization array.
6. It then calculates the number of combinations by choosing the current coin or not choosing it (two options), and sums the results for both options.
7. The function `findCombinations` initializes the memoization array `dp` and calls the `coinChange` function with appropriate parameters.

To follow up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Explain the purpose of the `coinChange` and `findCombinations` functions.
2. Can you explain the logic behind the recursive calls and memoization in the `coinChange` function?
3. How does the `coinChange` function handle base cases and overlapping subproblems?
4. Is there a way to optimize the space complexity of the dynamic programming array `dp`?

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the given solution is O(NS), where N is the number of coins and S is the target sum. This is because for each combination of coin and sum, we are performing constant-time operations and filling up the memoization array.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(NS) due to the memoization array `dp` of size 500x100 in the worst case, where 500 is the maximum target sum and 100 is the maximum number of coins.
