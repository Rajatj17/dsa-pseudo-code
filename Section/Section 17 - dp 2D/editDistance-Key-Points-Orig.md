The provided pseudo code is a C++ implementation to find the minimum edit distance between two strings using the recursive approach with memoization (dynamic programming). It uses the concept of recursion with memoization to minimize the distance between the two input strings.

The `minDistance` function takes two strings `str1` and `str2` along with their lengths `n1` and `n2` respectively as input, and a 2D array `dp` for memoization. It implements the logic to find the minimum edit distance between the two strings using recursion and memoization for optimization. The base cases check for empty strings and if the characters match at the current positions. If the characters don't match, it calculates the minimum distance considering the three operations: insert, remove, and replace, and returns the minimum of these distances.

The `editDistance` function initializes the memoization array, calculates the lengths of the input strings and then calls the `minDistance` function to find the minimum edit distance, returning the result.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer could ask the following questions:
1. Explain the purpose and working of the `minDistance` function.
2. Discuss the significance of memoization in the provided code.
3. How does the `editDistance` function use the `minDistance` function to calculate the edit distance between two strings?
4. Can you describe the time and space complexity of the provided code?

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the provided code is O(n1 * n2), where n1 and n2 are the lengths of the input strings `str1` and `str2`. This is because for each position in the input strings, there are three recursive calls and the memoization table ensures that each position is computed only once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the provided code is O(n1 * n2) due to the memoization array `dp` used to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
