The given pseudocode implements a dynamic programming solution for pattern matching using wildcard characters '?' and '*'. The main function `patternMatching` takes two input strings `s` and `p` and initializes a 2D array `dp` for memoization. It then calls the recursive function `match` to check if the pattern `p` matches the string `s`.

The function `match` takes the input strings `s` and `p`, their respective lengths `n` and `m`, and the 2D array `dp` for memoization. It checks for different conditions based on the wildcard characters in the pattern `p` and recursively finds the matching pattern for the string `s`.

Finally, the `patternMatching` function returns true if a valid match is found and false otherwise.

To follow up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask questions such as:
1. Explain the purpose of using dynamic programming in this pattern matching algorithm.
2. Could you explain the significance of the memoization array `dp` in the `match` function?
3. How does the recursive function handle wildcard characters '*' and '?'?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the given pseudocode is O(n*m) where n is the length of string `s` and m is the length of pattern `p`.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the pseudocode is O(n*m) for the memoization array `dp` and other variables used in the functions.

Overall, the given pseudocode provides an efficient solution for pattern matching using wildcard characters and demonstrates the use of dynamic programming for optimization.
