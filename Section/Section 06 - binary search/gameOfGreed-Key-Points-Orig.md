The given pseudo code consists of two functions:
1. `bool divideAmongK(vector<int> arr,int n,int k,int limit)`
   - This function checks whether it is possible to divide an array into k partitions such that each partition contains at least 'limit' number of coins.
   - It iterates through the array and keeps track of the current sum for each partition, then checks if the current partition exceeds the limit. It increments the count for valid partitions and resets the current sum.
   - It returns true if the count of valid partitions is greater than or equal to k.

2. `int getCoins(vector<int> arr,int k)`
   - This function finds the minimum number of coins that can be picked to ensure that each of the k partitions contains at least 'limit' number of coins.
   - It initializes the sum of all coins and sets a search range for the minimum number of coins.
   - It uses binary search to find the minimum number of coins.

To follow up on this pseudo code during an interview, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
- Ask the interviewee to explain how the `divideAmongK` function works and its significance in the `getCoins` function.
- Discuss the time and space complexity of the given code.
- Request the interviewee to provide test cases and run through the code with those test cases to see the output and understand the control flow.

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `divideAmongK` function is O(n) as it iterates through the array once.
- The time complexity of the `getCoins` function is O(n log s) where 'n' is the size of the array and 's' is the sum of all coins because of binary search.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) for both functions as they do not use any extra space proportional to the input array.

It's beneficial to discuss the time and space complexity during the interview to gauge the interviewee's understanding of the code's performance.
