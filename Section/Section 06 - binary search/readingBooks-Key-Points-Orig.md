The given code is for finding the minimum number of pages that each student should read to distribute the books fairly among 'm' students.

The function `isPossible` checks if it is possible to distribute books such that no student has to read more than 'mid' pages. It iterates through the books and keeps track of the current sum of pages read by the current student and the total number of students required to distribute the books.

The function `minPages` uses binary search to find the minimum number of pages. It initializes 'start' as the maximum number of pages in any book and 'end' as the sum of pages of all books. Then, it iteratively searches for the minimum number of pages using binary search and the `isPossible` function.

To follow up on this pseudocode in an interview, the interviewer may ask the following questions:
1. Explain how the `isPossible` function works and why it is needed in the `minPages` function.
2. How does the binary search algorithm work in the `minPages` function, and why is it used for this problem?
3. Can you explain the time and space complexity of the provided solution?

The time complexity of the provided solution is O(n log(sum of pages)), where 'n' is the number of books and 'sum of pages' is the sum of pages of all the books. This is because the binary search iterates log(sum of pages) times, and for each iteration, the isPossible function iterates through 'n' books, resulting in a total time complexity of O(n log(sum of pages)).

The space complexity of the solution is O(1), as the code uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
