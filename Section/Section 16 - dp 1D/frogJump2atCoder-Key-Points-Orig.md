The given pseudo code is for finding the minimum cost to reach the last stone from the first stone. The function "minimumCost" takes a vector of integers representing the positions of stones and an integer k as input and returns the minimum cost to reach the last stone.

Key points to solve the problem:
1. Create a DP array of size n and initialize all values with INT_MAX, where n is the number of stones.
2. Iterate through the stones and for each stone, find the minimum cost to reach the next k stones and update the DP array with the minimum cost.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the significance of the variable "k" in the problem?
2. How does the given pseudo code handle the possibility of not being able to jump k steps from a stone?
3. Can you explain the time and space complexity of the given solution?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the given solution is O(n*k) where n is the number of stones and k is the size of the jump. This is because for each stone, we are checking the next k stones to find the minimum cost.

Space Complexity: 
The space complexity of the given solution is O(n) where n is the number of stones. This is because we are using an additional DP array of size n.

It's always good to discuss possible optimizations and improvements in the code during the follow-up discussion.
