The given code implements a class MedianHandler, which is used to calculate the median of a stream of integers. The push method updates the median after every insertion, and the getMedian method returns the current median in O(1) time.

To calculate the median, two priority queues are used: left (max heap) and right (min heap). The left heap stores the smaller half of the elements, while the right heap stores the larger half. The median is maintained as the top element of the left heap or the average of the tops of the left and right heaps, depending on the size of the heaps.

The interviewer can follow-up on this pseudo code by asking the following questions:
1. How do priority queues work in C++?
2. What are the time and space complexities of the push and getMedian methods?
3. Can the space complexity be optimized in any way?
4. How would you handle edge cases, such as handling overflow or underflow in the priority queues?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the push method is O(log n) due to heap insertion and balancing operations, where n is the current number of elements in the priority queues.
- The time complexity of the getMedian method is O(1) since it directly returns the current median without any additional computations.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n) to store the input elements in the priority queues, where n is the current number of elements in the input stream.

Overall, the provided approach efficiently calculates the median in a streaming environment, and by using priority queues, it ensures that the median can be retrieved in constant time.
