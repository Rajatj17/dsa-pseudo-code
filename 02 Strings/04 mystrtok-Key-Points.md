The given code is an implementation of a custom tokenizer function `mystrtok` which works similarly to the standard library function `strtok()`. It takes in a string and a delimiter as input and returns the next token from the string.

Here are the key points of the provided pseudocode:
1. The `mystrtok` function takes a `char*` string and a `char` delimiter as input.
2. It uses a `static` variable `input` to maintain the state of the input string across function calls.
3. It allocates memory for the token dynamically using `new` keyword.
4. It iterates through the input string and finds the next token based on the delimiter.
5. After finding the token, it updates the `input` pointer to point to the next position in the input string.
6. It returns the token and sets `input` to `NULL` when the entire string has been tokenized.

To follow-up on this pseudocode during an interview, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. How does the `static` variable `input` help in maintaining the state of the input string across function calls?
2. How does the memory allocation for the token using `new` impact the performance and memory management of the code?
3. What happens if the input string contains multiple consecutive delimiters or a delimiter at the end?

The time complexity of this custom tokenizer function is O(n) where n is the length of the input string, as it iterates through the entire input string to find the next token.

The space complexity of the custom tokenizer function is O(1) as it does not use any additional space proportional to the input size, except for the space used for the token itself.
