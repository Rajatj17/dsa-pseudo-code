The given code takes an input string and creates a vector of tokens using whitespace as the delimiter. It then prints all the tokens in the vector.

To follow up on this pseudocode, the interviewer can ask the following questions or give the following tasks:
1. Explain the purpose of using the `stringstream` class and the `getline` function.
2. What is the significance of using a vector to store the tokens?
3. Can you explain the use of the `getline` function within the while loop?
4. Modify the code to count the number of tokens in the input string and print the count.

Time Complexity: 
- The code uses a single loop to iterate over each character in the input string, and a single loop to iterate over the tokens, thus the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the input string, as it uses a vector to store the tokens.

By discussing these points and tasks, the interviewer can assess the candidate's understanding of string manipulation, tokenization, and the use of standard library classes in C++.
