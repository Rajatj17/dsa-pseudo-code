The given pseudo code represents a program that takes a list of strings as an input, extracts a specific word at a given position from each string, then sorts and outputs the strings based on certain ordering criteria (lexicographic or numeric) and possibly in a reversed order. Here are the key points to solve the problem:

1. The `extractStringAtKey` function extracts and returns the word at a specific position from a given string.

2. The `convertToInt` function converts a string to an integer.

3. The `lexicoCompare` function compares two strings based on their keys in lexicographic order.

4. The `numericCompare` function compares two strings based on their keys as integers.

5. The main function reads the input, including the number of strings, the strings themselves, the key position to extract, the reversal flag, and the ordering criteria.

6. It then extracts the keys from each string, stores them in a vector of pairs (string, string), and sorts the vector based on the specified ordering criteria.

7. If the reversal flag is set to "true," the vector is reversed.

8. Finally, the sorted (and possibly reversed) strings are outputted.

To follow up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask about the specific implementation of the sorting and reversal algorithms, clarification on the input format and constraints, and potential edge cases that need to be handled.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the sorting algorithm used (either QuickSort or HeapSort, which have a time complexity of O(n log n)).
- The time complexity of extracting keys from each string and comparing them, which is O(k) for each string (where k is the length of the key).

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the vector of pairs used to store the strings and their respective keys.
- The space complexity of any additional data structures used in the sorting and comparison algorithms.

It's important to consider both time and space complexity while analyzing the efficiency of the given code.
