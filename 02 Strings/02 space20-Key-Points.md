The given code replaces the spaces in a string with '%20'. Here are the key points in the code:

1. Calculate the number of spaces in the input string.
2. Calculate the new length of the string after replacing spaces with '%20'.
3. Iterate through the input string in reverse and replace each space with '%20' in the new location.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are iterating through the input string at least once to count spaces and then again to replace the spaces.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed amount of extra space for variables and not creating any additional data structures that grow with the input size.

To follow up on this pseudo code, an interviewer could ask for optimizations in terms of reducing the number of iterations or improving the memory usage. Additionally, the interviewer could ask the candidate to write test cases to verify the correctness of the code.
