Based on the given code, here are the key points to solve the problem:

1. The code initializes a string variable 's' and a vector of strings 'sarr'.
2. It takes input 'n' which represents the number of strings and then reads 'n' strings and appends them to the 'sarr'.
3. After reading and storing the strings in 'sarr', the code prints each string in 'sarr' with a comma and a newline.

To follow-up on this pseudo code, an interviewer can ask the following questions:

1. What is the purpose of the string 's' in the code?
2. Can you explain the purpose of the vector of strings 'sarr' and how it is used in the code?
3. How does the loop that reads 'n' strings work? Is there a more efficient way to do this?
4. What is the significance of the 'using namespace std' statement in the code?

Time Complexity: 
Let's assume there are 'm' characters in each input string. Reading and storing 'n' strings in the vector takes O(n * m) time. Printing each string takes O(m) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * m).

Space Complexity: 
The space complexity is O(n * m) as we are storing 'n' strings, each of length 'm', in the vector 'sarr'.

Following up from the pseudo code, the interviewer can discuss different ways to optimize the input reading process, explore the trade-offs between using strings and character arrays, and discuss the impact of the 'using namespace std' statement on the code. Additionally, they can delve into the potential error handling for input reading and string manipulation.
