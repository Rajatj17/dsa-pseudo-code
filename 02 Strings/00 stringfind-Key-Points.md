The given C++ code aims to find the indices of the occurrences of a given word within a paragraph using the `find` function for strings.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:
1. The code defines a paragraph as "We are learning about STL strings. STL string class is quite powerful".
2. It then takes input from the user for a word to search within the paragraph.
3. It utilizes the `find` function to search for the word in the paragraph and outputs the index of the first occurrence if found. Then, it searches for the word from the next index and outputs the index of the second occurrence if found.

To follow-up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain how the `find` function works in this context?
2. What is the behavior of the `find` function if the word is not found in the paragraph?
3. Is there a more efficient way to search for multiple occurrences of a word in a paragraph?

Time complexity: 
The time complexity of the `find` function in C++'s `std::string` is O(N*M), where N is the size of the string and M is the size of the word being searched.

Space complexity: 
The space complexity of the provided code is O(1), as it only uses a fixed amount of memory for variables regardless of the input size.
