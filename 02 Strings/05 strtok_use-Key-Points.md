The given code takes a string as input and uses the `strtok()` function to tokenize the string based on a delimiter.

Key points:
1. The code uses the `strtok()` function to tokenize the input string.
2. The input string is tokenized based on the space delimiter " ".

To follow-up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain how the `strtok()` function works?
2. How would you modify the code to tokenize the input string based on a different delimiter?
3. What are the possible drawbacks or limitations of using `strtok()` for tokenization?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of tokenizing the string using `strtok()` is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. 

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the code is O(1), as it only uses a fixed-size character array for input and does not allocate additional space based on the input size.
