The given code is used to find all occurrences of a small string within a larger string and return their indices in a vector.

Here are the main steps:
1. Define a function called stringSearch that takes a large string and a small string as input.
2. Declare a vector to store the indices of all occurrences of the small string in the large string.
3. Use the find method to find the first occurrence of the small string in the large string.
4. While there are still occurrences of the small string, push the index into the vector and continue searching for the next occurrence.
5. Return the vector containing all the indices.

The interviewer can follow up with questions to optimize the search algorithm, handle case sensitivity, and discuss potential improvements in code readability and the use of standard libraries.

Time complexity: O(n*m) where n is the length of the big string and m is the length of the small string.
Space complexity: O(k) where k is the number of occurrences of the small string in the big string.
