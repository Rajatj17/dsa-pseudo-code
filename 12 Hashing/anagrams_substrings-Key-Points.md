The given pseudo code contains a function that calculates the number of pairs of substrings that are anagrams of each other in a given string.

Here are the key points to solve the problem based on the provided pseudo code:
1. The function `getHashValue` calculates the hash value of a substring by counting the frequency of each character in the substring.
2. The `anagrams_substrings` function generates all substrings of the input string, calculates their hash values using the `getHashValue` function, and then stores the frequency of each hash value in a map.
3. After counting the frequency of each hash value, the function calculates the number of pairs of substrings that are anagrams of each other by iterating through the map and summing up the frequencies.

Follow-up for the interviewer:
The interviewer can follow up with the following questions:
1. Can we optimize the solution further to reduce the time complexity?
2. Can we improve the space complexity of the solution?
3. How would you handle a scenario where the input string is very large?
4. Is there a way to avoid recalculating the hash value for each substring?

Time complexity: O(n^3), where n is the length of the input string.
Space complexity: O(n^2), as the map can potentially store the frequency of all possible hash values of substrings.
