The given code implements a function to count the number of triplets (i, j, k) from the array, such that j is divisible by i and k is divisible by j. The count_triplets function takes a vector of integers 'arr' and an integer 'r' as input, and returns the count of such triplets. 

The function uses two unordered_maps, 'right' and 'left', to store the frequency of elements. It then iterates through the array, updating the maps and calculating the count of triplets based on the current element and its multiples.

To follow up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the purpose of the 'right' and 'left' maps in the code?
2. How does the logic inside the count_triplets function help in counting the triplets?
3. What will be the expected output for a given input array and value of 'r'?
4. Can you provide a sample input and the corresponding output to demonstrate the working of the function?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the count_triplets function is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because the function iterates through the array once and performs constant time operations within the loop.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the count_triplets function is O(n) due to the two unordered_maps 'right' and 'left', which can store at most 'n' unique elements from the input array.

Interviewer can also ask the candidate about the time and space complexity for each specific part of code and whole code after understanding the base time and space complexity of initial solution.
