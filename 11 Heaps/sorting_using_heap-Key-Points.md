The given code is an implementation of a min-heap using the C++ STL priority_queue. It initializes an array, populates the priority_queue with its elements, and then prints the elements in ascending order by repeatedly popping the top element of the priority_queue.

Here's a breakdown of the pseudocode:
1. Initialize an array of integers.
2. Calculate the size of the array.
3. Create a min-heap using the priority_queue class with the greater<int> comparator.
4. Iterate through the array and push each element onto the min-heap.
5. While the min-heap is not empty, print the top element of the min heap and then pop it.

The interviewer can follow-up on this pseudocode by asking the following questions:
1. Explain the purpose of using the priority_queue with the greater<int> comparator.
2. Compare and contrast min-heap and max-heap. How would you modify the code to create a max-heap instead?
3. Explain the time complexity of pushing elements onto the priority_queue and the time complexity of popping elements from it.
4. How would you modify the code to perform other operations on the min-heap, such as inserting a new element or deleting a specific element?
5. Can you implement a heap without using the priority_queue class?

Time Complexity:
- Pushing elements onto the priority_queue: O(log n) for each element, where n is the number of elements in the min-heap.
- Popping elements from the priority_queue: O(log n) for each element, where n is the number of elements in the min-heap.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the given code is O(n) to store the array elements in the min-heap.
