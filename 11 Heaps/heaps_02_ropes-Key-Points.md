The given code is an implementation of the "Minimum Cost to Connect Ropes" problem using a priority queue to efficiently solve the problem. The problem is to connect n ropes with minimum cost.

Key points to solve the problem:
1. Create a min-heap (priority_queue) of ropes' lengths using the given array of ropes.
2. Remove the two smallest ropes from the heap, connect them, and add the cost of their connection to the total cost.
3. Push the new connected rope length back to the heap.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until only one rope remains in the heap.

Pseudo code for the problem:
```
join_ropes(ropes[], n):
    Create a priority queue (min-heap) using the given array of ropes
    cost = 0

    while size of priority queue > 1:
        A = top element of priority queue
        Remove A from priority queue

        B = top element of priority queue
        Remove B from priority queue

        new_rope = A + B
        cost += new_rope
        Push new_rope into the priority queue

    Return cost
```

Follow-up:
To improve the understanding of the applicant's knowledge, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the time complexity of the join_ropes function?
2. Can you explain the space complexity of the join_ropes function?
3. How would you modify the join_ropes function to handle a very large number of ropes efficiently?

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the join_ropes function is O(N log N) where N is the number of ropes. This is because for each rope, adding it to the priority queue takes O(log N) time, and since there are N ropes, the overall time complexity is O(N log N).

Space Complexity: 
The space complexity of the join_ropes function is O(N) where N is the number of ropes. This is because the priority queue (min-heap) will store at most N elements from the input array of ropes.

To handle a very large number of ropes efficiently, the join_ropes function can be modified to use a custom heap implementation or a different data structure that can handle a large number of elements while maintaining efficient time complexity. For example, a custom min-heap implementation with optimized memory allocation or a data structure like a binary heap or Fibonacci heap could be used to handle a large number of ropes efficiently.
