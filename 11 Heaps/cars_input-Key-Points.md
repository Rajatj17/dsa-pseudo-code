To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue to store the distances of the customers from the origin and then select the top K distances. Here's a pseudo code to solve the problem:

```
import heapq

def topKCustomers(customers, k):
    pq = []
    for customer in customers:
        distance = customer[1]**2 + customer[2]**2
        heapq.heappush(pq, (-distance, customer[0]))
        if len(pq) > k:
            heapq.heappop(pq)
    
    top_customers = []
    while pq:
        top_customers.append(heapq.heappop(pq)[1])
    
    return top_customers[::-1]

# Input: customers (list of tuples), k (integer)
# Output: top customers (list of names)

customers = [("C1", 1, 1), ("C2", 2, 1), ("C3", 3, 2), ("C4", 0, 1), ("C5", 2, 3)]
k = 3
top_customers = topKCustomers(customers, k)
print(top_customers)
```

To follow up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the process of choosing the top K customers using the priority queue?
2. How does the heapq module work in Python and why is it used in this context?
3. Can you analyze the time and space complexity of this solution?

Time Complexity: The time complexity of this solution is O(n log k), where n is the number of customers and k is the number of top customers required. The O(log k) factor comes from the heap operations performed on the priority queue.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of this solution is O(k), as we are storing at most k customer distances in the priority queue.
