The given pseudo code demonstrates the usage of a priority queue in C++. It creates a priority queue using a custom comparator class and then pushes the elements from an array into the priority queue. Then, it prints the elements after popping them from the priority queue.

To follow-up on this pseudo code, the interviewer can discuss the following points:
1. Ask the candidate to explain the purpose of the Compare class and how it is used in the priority queue.
2. Inquire about the time complexity of the operations performed on the priority queue, such as push, pop, and top.
3. Discuss any potential alternative data structures or approaches that could be used to achieve the same goal.

Time complexity:
- Pushing an element into the priority queue: O(log n)
- Popping an element from the priority queue: O(log n)
- Accessing the top element of the priority queue: O(1)

Space complexity: O(n) for the array of size n and the priority queue created.
