The given code implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache data structure using a doubly linked list and a hash map. Below are the key points to understand the implementation:

1. Define a class `Node` to store key-value pairs in a doubly linked list.
2. Define a class `LRUCache` with a maximum size, a doubly linked list `l`, and a hash map `m`.
3. When a new key-value pair is inserted, if the key is already present, update the value. If not, check if the cache is full. If it is full, remove the least recently used item from the cache.
4. Use the hash map to store the iterator pointing to the corresponding node in the linked list for O(1) access.

To follow-up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
- Can you explain how the LRU cache is implemented using a doubly linked list and a hash map?
- How does the `insertKeyValue` function work, and what is the time complexity for inserting a new key-value pair?
- How is the least recently used item removed from the cache, and what is the time complexity for this operation?
- Can you explain the purpose of the `mostRecentKey` and `getValue` functions in the LRU cache implementation?

Time Complexity:
- Inserting a key-value pair: O(1) on average (due to hash map) and O(n) in the worst case if the cache is full and the least recently used item needs to be removed.
- Accessing a key-value pair: O(1) due to hash map.
- Removing the least recently used item: O(1) due to doubly linked list.

Space Complexity:
- O(n) where n is the maximum size of the LRU Cache.

The interviewer may also explore additional questions related to hash maps, linked lists, and their use in the LRU cache implementation.
