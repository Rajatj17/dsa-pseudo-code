The problem is to find the minimum number of jumps required for a frog to reach the end of the array, where each integer in the array represents the maximum number of steps the frog can take.

## Example
Input
```plaintext
arr = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
```
Output
```plaintext
Minimum jumps required: 2
```

## Pseudocode
```plaintext
Function minJumps(arr):
    n = arr.length
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    if arr[0] == 0:
        return -1

    jumps = 1
    farthest = arr[0]
    currentEnd = arr[0]

    Loop i from 1 to n-1:
        if i == n-1:
            return jumps
        farthest = max(farthest, i + arr[i])
        if i == currentEnd:
            jumps++
            currentEnd = farthest
```

This pseudocode will help in finding the minimum jumps required by the frog to reach the end of the array.
