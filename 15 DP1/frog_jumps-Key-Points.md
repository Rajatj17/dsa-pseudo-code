# Pseudocode
1. Initialize a variable "currentPos" to 0 and a variable "jumps" to 0.
2. Create a loop that runs while "currentPos" is less than the length of the array minus 1.
3. Inside the loop, find the maximum reachable position from the current position based on the integer at that position.
4. Update the "currentPos" to the maximum reachable position found in the previous step.
5. Increment the "jumps" by 1.
6. Return the value of "jumps" as the minimum jumps required by the frog to reach the end of the array.

```python
def minJumps(array):
    currentPos = 0
    jumps = 0
    while currentPos < len(array) - 1:
        maxReach = 0
        maxIndex = 0
        for i in range(1, array[currentPos] + 1):
            if currentPos + i >= len(array) - 1:
                return jumps + 1
            if i + array[currentPos + i] > maxReach:
                maxReach = array[currentPos + i] + i
                maxIndex = currentPos + i
        currentPos = maxIndex
        jumps += 1
    return jumps

# Test the function
arr = [2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 0, 1, 1]
print(minJumps(arr))  # Output: 4
```

To follow-up on this pseudocode, the interviewer can ask the following questions:

1. Can you explain the logic behind choosing the maximum reachable position in each step?
2. How would you optimize the function to return the actual path the frog takes to reach the end, instead of just the minimum jumps?
3. In what scenarios might this algorithm not work optimally, and how would you address those scenarios?

Time Complexity: O(n^2) - In the worst case, the algorithm might iterate through the array using nested loops.
Space Complexity: O(1) - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input array size.
