The given code implements a solution to find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two given strings using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.

Key points to solve the problem:
1. Define a function lcs() to calculate the Longest Common Subsequence of two strings.
2. Initialize 2D DP array with size (n1 + 1) x (n2 + 1) where n1 and n2 are the lengths of the input strings.
3. Iterate through the strings using nested loops and compare characters to fill the DP array according to the LCS calculation logic.
4. Reverse traverse the DP array to find the LCS characters and store them in a vector.
5. Print the characters of the LCS.

An interviewer can follow-up on this pseudo code by asking the following questions:
- Explain the time and space complexity of the given solution.
- Can you optimize the space complexity of the DP array?
- Can you modify the function to return the actual LCS string instead of just its length?
- Can you demonstrate the application of this algorithm in real-world scenarios?

Time Complexity: O(n1 * n2), where n1 and n2 are the lengths of the input strings.
Space Complexity: O(n1 * n2), for the DP array.

Interviewer can also consider asking questions related to the application of bottom-up approach to the LCS problem and its use cases in different fields such as bioinformatics, version control systems, etc.
