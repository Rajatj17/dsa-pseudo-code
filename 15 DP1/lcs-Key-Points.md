The given code implements the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) using recursion and memoization. The function `lcs` takes two strings `s1` and `s2`, along with their lengths `i` and `j` respectively, and a 2D vector `dp` for memoization. It returns the length of the LCS of `s1` and `s2`.

The code defines a recursive approach to solving the problem with memoization to avoid redundant computations. It checks for the base case where the length of the strings is reached and then recursively calculates the LCS for the remaining substrings, memoizing the results.

To follow-up on this pseudo code, the interviewer could ask questions such as:
1. How does memoization improve the time complexity of the recursive approach?
2. Can you provide the iterative approach to solve the LCS problem without using recursion?
3. How would you handle cases with multiple LCS sequences? 

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the given code is O(n1*n2), where n1 and n2 are the lengths of the input strings s1 and s2, respectively. This is because each state (i, j) is calculated only once due to memoization.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the given code is O(n1*n2) for the memoization table, where n1 and n2 are the lengths of the input strings s1 and s2. Additionally, there is O(n1 + n2) space used for the strings s1 and s2.
