The given code is an implementation of the Rod Cutting problem in C++. It demonstrates both a recursive solution and a bottom-up dynamic programming solution to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by cutting a rod of length 'n' and selling the pieces, where different pieces have different prices.

Key points to solve the problem:
1. The recursive solution uses a base case to return 0 when the length of the rod is less than or equal to 0.
2. It iterates through all possible cuts and calculates the maximum profit recursively.
3. The bottom-up dynamic programming solution uses an array 'dp' to store the maximum profit for each length of the rod.
4. It iterates through all possible lengths and calculates the maximum profit using the values stored in the 'dp' array.

Follow-up questions for the interviewer:
1. What are the trade-offs between the recursive and dynamic programming solutions in terms of time and space complexity?
2. Can we optimize the space complexity of the dynamic programming solution?
3. How would you handle cases where the rod-cutting problem involves large input sizes or a large number of test cases?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the recursive solution is O(2^n) due to the overlapping subproblems.
- The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution is O(n^2) as it involves nested loops to calculate each dp[i].

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the recursive solution is O(n) due to the recursive stack.
- The space complexity of the dynamic programming solution is O(n) due to the 'dp' array of size 'n+1'.
