The given code is used to find the number of inversions in an array. An inversion in an array occurs when there are two indices i and j such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. 

The merge method is used to count the inversions while merging the two sorted halves. And the inversion_count method is a classic recursive divide and conquer approach to solve this problem.

To simplify what the code does:
1. It uses the merge method to count the inversions while merging two sorted halves of the array.
2. It uses the inversion_count method to recursively divide the array into smaller sub-arrays and count inversions in each sub-array.

Interviewer can follow up with: 
- Can you explain the merge method in more detail?
- Can you explain the inversion_count method in more detail?
- How can you modify the code to handle large input sizes efficiently?

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - The algorithm uses a divide and conquer approach, and the merge method takes O(n) time. Since the algorithm is dividing the input in half each time, it results in a time complexity of O(n log n).

Space Complexity: O(n) - The space complexity is O(n) as we are using a temporary array to store the merged elements. The recursion also contributes O(log n) space to the stack.
