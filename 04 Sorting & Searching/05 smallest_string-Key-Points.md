The given code takes an array of strings and sorts them in a way that when the sorted strings are concatenated, they form the smallest possible number.

To implement this, a custom comparison function `compare` is used which concatenates two strings in both orders and then compares both results to find the lexicographically smaller string. This comparison function is then passed to the `sort` function to sort the array of strings.

Interviewer can follow-up with the following questions:
1. Could you explain how the `compare` function works in detail?
2. Is there any other way to solve this problem without using a custom comparison function?
3. Can you explain the time and space complexity of the given solution?

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the given solution is O(n * m * log n), where n is the number of strings in the array and m is the average length of the strings. This complexity arises due to the sorting algorithm used (typically quicksort or mergesort).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the given solution is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the array. This is because the array of strings is the only significant data structure that grows with the input size.
