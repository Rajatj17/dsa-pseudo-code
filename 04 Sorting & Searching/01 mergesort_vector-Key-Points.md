The given pseudocode is implementing the merge sort algorithm to sort a given array of integers. Here are the key points to solve the problem:

1. The merge method takes a vector (array) of integers, a start index (s), and an end index (e) as input and merges the two sorted halves of the array into a single sorted array.

2. Within the merge method, a temp vector is used to store the sorted elements while comparing and merging the two halves of the array.

3. After merging the elements into the temp vector, the sorted elements are copied back to the original array using a for loop.

4. The mergesort method implements the recursive merge sort algorithm by dividing the array into two halves and recursively calling itself on each half until the base case is reached (i.e., single element or empty array).

5. The base case of the mergesort method checks if the start index (s) is greater than or equal to the end index (e), in which case it returns without doing anything.

6. The mergesort method then calculates the middle index and recursively calls itself on the two halves of the array before merging them using the merge method.

To follow up on this pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:

1. Explain the merge sort algorithm and its time complexity.
2. How does the merge method work, and what is the purpose of the temp vector?
3. Describe the base case and recursive case in the mergesort method.
4. Can you analyze the time complexity and space complexity of the merge sort algorithm?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the array is divided into two halves at each recursive step, and the merging process takes O(n) time.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n) due to the temporary storage of the elements in the temp vector during the merging process. Additionally, the recursive calls also contribute to the space complexity.
