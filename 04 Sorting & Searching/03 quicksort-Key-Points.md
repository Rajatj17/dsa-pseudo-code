The provided code aims to implement the quicksort algorithm for sorting a given array of integers.

The key points to understand in the provided code are:
1. The partition function is used to find the correct position of the pivot element in the array.
2. The quicksort function recursively applies the partitioning logic to sort the array.
3. The main function initializes an array, calls the quicksort function, and then prints the sorted array.

To follow up on the provided pseudocode, an interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Explain how the partition function works and its role in the quicksort algorithm.
2. Walk through the quicksort function and explain how it recursively sorts the array.
3. Discuss the time and space complexity of the quicksort algorithm and how it compares to other sorting algorithms.
4. Can you optimize the given implementation of the quicksort algorithm?

Time Complexity: 
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n^2)

Space Complexity:
- O(log n) due to the recursive calls on the stack.
