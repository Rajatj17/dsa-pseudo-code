The given code is for finding the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.

The function `unique_substring` takes a string `str` as input and returns the longest substring in `str` without repeating characters.

The main logic is to use two pointers `i` and `j` to represent the current window, and a hashmap `m` to store the index of the last occurrence of each character. Whenever a repeating character is found, the window is shifted to exclude the repeated character, and the length of the current window is calculated. The maximum window length and the start index of the window are updated at each step.

To follow up on this pseudocode, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. How does the code handle empty strings or strings with only one character?
2. What data structures are being used in the code and why?
3. Can you explain the logic behind updating the window and the hashmap at each step?
4. Can you provide some test cases to validate the implementation of this code?

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the given code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the code uses a single pass through the input string and performs constant time operations at each step.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the given code is O(1) since the space used is independent of the input size, apart from the input string itself. The hashmap `m` will have a maximum of 256 entries (assuming ASCII character set), which is constant space. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).
