The given pseudocode is for finding the smallest window in a string "s" which contains all characters of another string "p".

To follow up on this pseudocode, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the logic behind using two arrays FP and FS as frequency maps?
2. Why are we using the sliding window algorithm here?
3. What is the significance of the variables cnt, start, start_idx, min_so_far, and window_size?
4. How does the contraction step work, and why are we contracting from the left?
5. What is the purpose of the while loop inside the contraction step?
6. Can you explain the condition for finding the window with all characters of the pattern?

Time Complexity: 
- The time complexity of the given pseudocode is O(n), where n is the length of the string "s".

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(1) because a fixed-size array of 256 elements is used for storing the frequency maps.

The interviewer can further discuss different test cases and edge cases to evaluate the efficiency and correctness of the code. They can also discuss further optimizations or alternative approaches for solving the problem.
