The given code implements a function `housing` to find the smallest window in the `plots` array such that the sum of elements in the window is equal to a given integer `k`.
Pseudo Code:
```
1. Initialize variables i=0, j=0, cs=0
2. While j is less than n:
    a. Add arr[j] to cs and increment j
    b. While cs is greater than k and i < j:
        i. Subtract arr[i] from cs and increment i
    c. If cs is equal to k:
        Print the window i to j-1
3. Return
```
Interviewer follow-up:
To further discuss the approach and code, the interviewer may ask the following questions:
1. Can you explain the logic behind the given approach and how it helps in finding the smallest window summing up to k?
2. How does the algorithm ensure that the window found is the smallest possible window with the required sum?
3. Can you explain the time and space complexity of your implementation?

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the given code is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array `plots`. This is because the algorithm processes each element in the array only once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the given code is O(1) because the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
