The given pseudocode is for finding the maximum element in all subarrays of size k in a given array.

Key points to solve the problem:
1. The algorithm uses a deque to maintain the indices of the elements in the current window of size k.
2. It processes the first k elements separately and then iterates through the array for the remaining elements.
3. During the iteration, it maintains the maximum element index in the current window and updates the deque based on the new elements encountered.

To follow up on this pseudocode, the interviewer can ask for a step-by-step walkthrough of the algorithm for a given input array and window size, discussing how the deque is updated at each step.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(k)

The time complexity is O(n) because the algorithm processes each element of the input array once. The space complexity is O(k) because the deque's size is bounded by the window size k.
