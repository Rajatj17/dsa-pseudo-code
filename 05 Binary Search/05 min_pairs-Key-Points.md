The provided code aims to find the minimum absolute difference pair between two arrays `a1` and `a2`. Here are the key points to understand the code:

1. Two arrays `a1` and `a2` are provided.
2. The function `min_pair` takes two vectors as input and finds the pair of elements from both arrays such that their absolute difference is minimum.

Pseudo code to find the minimum absolute difference pair between two arrays:

```
min_pair(a1, a2):
    1. Sort the second array a2 in ascending order.
    2. Initialize variables p1, p2, and diff.
    3. Set diff to maximum integer value.
    4. Iterate over elements x in array a1.
        a. Find the lower bound index lb of x in array a2.
        b. Check if x - a2[lb-1] < diff, update p1, p2, and diff if true.
        c. Check if a2[lb] - x < diff, update p1, p2, and diff if true.
    5. Output the minimum pair p1 and p2.

```

To follow-up on the pseudo code during an interview, the interviewer can ask the following questions:
1. How does the lower_bound function work and what is its time complexity?
2. What is the significance of sorting the second array a2 before finding the minimum pair?
3. Can you explain the logic behind updating p1, p2, and diff in the loop?
4. Are there any edge cases or special scenarios to consider when implementing this algorithm?

Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the provided code is O(n log n) due to the sorting of array a2, where n is the size of array a2. The rest of the operations take O(n) time.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the size of the input arrays a1 and a2. This is due to the space used by the input arrays and some additional space used for variables and intermediate calculations.
