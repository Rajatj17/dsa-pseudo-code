The given code demonstrates the implementation of the lower_bound and upper_bound functions, which are used to find the lower and upper bounds of an element in a sorted array, respectively. The lower_bound function returns the index of the first occurrence of the key in the array, while the upper_bound function returns the index of the next element greater than the key.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
1. The lower_bound function uses a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of the key in the array.
2. The upper_bound function also uses a binary search algorithm to find the next element greater than the key in the array.
3. The main function demonstrates the usage of these functions with a sample array and prints the count of occurrences of the key (in this case, 3) using the calculated upper and lower bounds.
4. The code also uses the STL (Standard Template Library) functions `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` to achieve the same result.

Follow-up for the interviewer:
1. You can ask the interviewee to explain the time and space complexity of the binary search algorithm used in the lower_bound and upper_bound functions.
2. You can discuss edge cases and scenarios where these functions may behave differently from the standard library implementations.

Time complexity:
- The time complexity of the binary search algorithm used in both lower_bound and upper_bound functions is O(log n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because the algorithm reduces the search space by half in each iteration.

Space complexity:
- The space complexity of the given code is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of extra space for variables and does not allocate any additional dynamic memory.

To evaluate the interviewee's understanding:
1. Ask them to analyze the worst-case, best-case, and average-case time complexity of the binary search algorithm used in the given functions.
2. Encourage them to compare the performance and limitations of their implementation with the STL version of lower_bound and upper_bound functions, and discuss when and why to use custom implementations.
