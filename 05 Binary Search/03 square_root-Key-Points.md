The given code contains a function `square_root` that takes two parameters `N` and `P` and returns the square root of N up to P decimal places. The main algorithm used is Binary Search to find the integer part of the square root and then a Linear Search to find the floating part of the square root up to P decimal places.

1. The function `square_root` first performs Binary Search to find the integer part of the square root of N.
2. Then, it uses Linear Search to find the floating part of the square root up to P decimal places.
3. The final result is returned as a float.

A interviewer can follow-up on this pseudocode by asking questions such as:
- Explain the Binary Search approach used in this code.
- Describe the purpose of the Linear Search for finding the decimal places of the square root.
- Discuss the time and space complexity of the square root function.

Time Complexity:
Binary Search takes O(log N) time.
Linear Search takes O(P) time.
So, the overall time complexity is O(log N + P).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as the code only uses a few variables and does not require any additional space that grows with the input size.
